`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:'Next, you should consider the "kinds" of transactions your game will be making. You can likely bucket the transactions into different categories.

`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"Once you've categorized each of your transactions, consider your end-user's expectations around those transactions as well as your expectations as the game developer. How much delay is acceptable from an end-user's perpective for a transaction to process?

`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"The writer of this guide often generalizes transactions as high-value or low-value."}),`
`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:[e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"High-value transactions"}),` typically need confirmation before providing the end-user with feedback. Transactions can fail for a number of reasons (no internet, insufficient gas, invalid assumptions, etc.). If we assume a high-value transaction will pass and give the user feedback right away then later on the transaction ends up failing, we will not be able to recover without negatively impacting the user or our bottom line. Consider, for example, an in-game storefront. If a user's "buy sword" transaction fails, we would either need to revoke the sword from their account (hurting the player experience) or lose out on the revenue from the sale (hurting the bottom line). Conveniently, most high-value transactions coincide with activities where users are usually accustumed to having a short wait time in traditional (non-blockchain) games such as storefronts, crafting, upgrading, etc.`]}),`
`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:[e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"Low-value transactions"})," can, and often should, provide user feedback right away. We do not need to wait for a transaction confirmation before the in-game feedback takes place. If the transaction does end up failing, we can easily recover without negatively impacting the player experience or our bottom line in most cases. Players will typically be accustumed to receiving instant feedback for these actions in traditional games. For example: when a user collects a coin in a platformer (or similar) they expect to see the collected coin get reflected in the UI immediately. The player is unlikely to remember their exact coin total in the following game session and/or it is unlikely to impact the developer's bottom line if they locally store the collected coins and re-submit the transaction when network issues are resolved (or similar)."]}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"Finally, you should consider how frequently your game should be making transactions. Some games will have the user taking many actions that impact the game state in a short period of time. Imagine submitting a transaction to the blockchain every time Mario collected a coin... The costs would quickly become prohibitive, bundle those low-value transactions together!"}),`

Then, you can have your transactions be submitted ever x seconds or whenever a function call is made but no sooner than every y seconds (overrideable for high-value transactions), etc. To learn more about working with the ",e.jsx(n.code,{children:"TransactionQueuer"}),"s, please see ",e.jsx(n.a,{href:"/sdk/unity/write-to-blockchain#transaction-queuers",children:"this doc"}),"."]}),`
