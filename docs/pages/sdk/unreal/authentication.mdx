# Authentication

### Customizing the builtin GUI

In the folder located at All/Plugins/SequencePlugin Content/Core/Style you'll find a struct F_SequenceUIStyle,
In the default values section of this struct you'll be able to update the colours and images displayed throughout the UI.
For beta we currently only read from Sequence_Style_Dark_Mode

### Custom UI Integration

In a C++ UObject with a series of pass through `[UFUNCTIONS]` setup similarly to `[SequenceBackendManager.h/.cpp]`. Each of these calls are implemented in **[UAuthenticator]** you just need to pass through the data with YOUR UAuthenticator UObject

```
/*
   Used to initiate mobile Social Signin
   (No other calls need to be made to complete mobile SSO)
*/
void InitiateMobileSSO(const ESocialSigninType& Type)

/*
   Optional Call,
   Used to set a custom encryptor implementation for the Authentication Process
*/
void SetCustomEncryptor(UGenericNativeEncryptor * EncryptorIn);

/*
   This call is for generating a login URL for Desktop based Social Signin
   the received URL is fed into a WebBrowser to begin the login process
*/
FString GetLoginURL(const ESocialSigninType& Type); 

/*
   This is call is for undergoing social login once an ID_Token has been collected.
*/
void SocialLogin(const FString& IDTokenIn);

/*
   This Call is made after you've collected the email address from the Users in the UI
   The Delegate **[AuthRequiresCode]** will fire when a code is ready to be received
   by the UAuthenticator
*/
void EmailLogin(const FString& EmailIn);

/*
   This is call is made after the Delegate **[AuthRequiresCode]** is fired
   The Code collected from the User in the GUI is sent in via this call
*/
void EmailCode(const FString& CodeIn);

/*
   Optional call used to retrieve stored credentials on disk
*/
FStoredCredentials_BE GetStoredCredentials() const;

/*
   Optional call used to check if the credentials on disk are valid or not
*/
bool StoredCredentialsValid();
```

To start you'll want to create a `[UAuthenticator]` UObject like so `[UAuthenticator * Auth = NewObject<UAuthenticator>()]`, this UObject manages the authentication side of Sequence.

Be sure to bind to the Delegates for `[AuthSuccess]`, `[AuthFailure]`, `[AuthRequiresCode]` prior to making any signin calls You can bind to these delegates like so:

```
this->authenticator->AuthRequiresCode.AddDynamic(this, &AYourClass::YourCallReadyToReceiveCode);
this->authenticator->AuthFailure.AddDynamic(this, &AYourClass::YourCallShowAuthFailureScreen);
```

In the case of **[AuthSuccess]** since a parameter is also passed we bind to it like this

```
FScriptDelegate del;
del.BindUFunction(this, "CallShowAuthSuccessScreen");
this->authenticator->AuthSuccess.Add(del);
```

Note: Replace the usage of the SequenceBackendManager.h/.cpp with you're own when building a custom GUI,
it is only used here as a reference in the event more context is needed with these instructions.
Where `[CallShowAuthSuccessScreen]` is defined in `SequenceBackendManager.h` as an example like so:

```
UFUNCTION()
void CallShowAuthSuccessScreen(const FCredentials_BE& CredentialsIn);
```

And in `SequenceBackendManager.cpp` like so:

```
void ASequenceBackendManager::CallShowAuthSuccessScreen(const FCredentials_BE& CredentialsIn) 
{
this->Credentials = CredentialsIn;
if (this->ShowAuthSuccessDelegate.IsBound())
  this->ShowAuthSuccessDelegate.Broadcast(Credentials);
else
  UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("**[Nothing bound to: ShowAuthSuccessDelegate]**"));
}
```

### Email based Authentication With CustomUI

1) To start email based authentication you'll start it with this call **[EmailLogin(const FString& EmailIn)]**, supplying an email you've collected from the User in your GUI.

2) Next **[AuthRequiresCode]** will fire when the **[UAuthenticator]** is ready to receive the Code from your UI. Collect this code from your GUI and send it to the authenticator using **[EmailCode(CodeIn)]**.

3) Finally **[AuthSuccess]** will fire with a Credentials_BE struct as a parameter. You are done Email Based Auth.

### Social Signin based Authentication on Desktop With CustomUI

1) To start SSO based authentication with desktop you can either use your own implementation to get the necessary id_token or you can make use of Unreal's web browser plugin.

2) To get the URL to navigate to you can use the UAuthenticator supplied call **[FString GetSigninURL(const ESocialSigninType& Type)]** where Type is the social login type you wish to use

3) With whatever implementation you chose you can forward the collected id_token to the UAuthenticator object with **[SocialLogin(const FString& IDTokenIn)]**, after which **[AuthSuccess]** will fire and you're done desktop based SSO.

### Social Signin based Authentication on Mobile With CustomUI

1) To start mobile SSO you will need to make use of the **[UAuthenticator::InitiateMobileSSO(const ESocialSigninType& Type)]**
   where type is the Type of SSO you want to use. IE) Google or Apple, for the time being Discord & Facebook aren't supported.
   This function call is all that's required for Mobile SSO.

### Android SSO Requirements

Google:

In order to be able to properly use Google Auth, create and place the Keystore file by following [these instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/signing-android-projects-for-release-on-the-google-play-store-with-unreal-engine/).

You will also need to generate an **[Android client ID]** and a **[Web Application client ID]** for your application. And place the **[Web Application client ID]** in the [YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini], [GoogleClientID] field.

Refer to [these docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/android/get-started#api-console) to generate **[Android client ID]** and **[Web Application client ID]**.

[This guide](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth) helps explain how to collect SHA-1 key fingerprints for the **[Android client ID]**.

Apple: Please ensure you have a proper **[AppleClientID]** set in **[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]**

### IOS SSO Requirements
Google: Please ensure you have a proper **[GoogleClientID]** set in **[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]**

Apple: Please ensure you have a proper **[AppleClientID]** set in **[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]**,
be sure you register and set your bundle identifier properly for your app

### Apple Specific SSO Requirements
For Apple SSO to work please be sure to register the **[RedirectUrl]** in **[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]** appropriately for your app.
