# Working with Blueprint

Full Blueprint support for the Sequence Unreal Plugin is available starting with Unreal Engine version 5.4.

In order to work with the Sequence API using Blueprint, you should first create an actor or pawn and attach the `AC_SequencePawn_Component`.

Example Blueprint usage can be found in the `BP_CustomSpectatorPawn` found in `SequencePlugin Content > Core > Demonstration`. Use these as a reference when constructing your own Blueprint integrations.
