# Introduction

The Sequence Unreal Embedded Wallet SDK provides full Sequence [Embedded Wallet](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/overview) and [Indexer](/api/indexer/overview) integration for games built on the Unreal Framework.

This SDK follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`major.minor.patch`). Breaking changes will always cause a `major` version increment, non-breaking new features will cause a `minor` version increment, and bugfixes will cause a `patch` version increment.
