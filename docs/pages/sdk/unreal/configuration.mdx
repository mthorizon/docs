# Configuration

::::steps

## Private Dependency Modules

In your Project's Build.cs file ([where to find](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/where-are-build-cs-and-target-cs/302665)) please check the private Dependency module such that it includes "SequencePlugin":

```cpp
    public SequenceTest(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;
		PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore" });
        //The line below is what you want
		PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "SequencePlugin" });
		// Uncomment if you are using Slate UI
		// PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Slate", "SlateCore" });
		// Uncomment if you are using online features
		// PrivateDependencyModuleNames.Add("OnlineSubsystem");
		// To include OnlineSubsystemSteam, add it to the plugins section in your uproject file with the Enabled attribute set to true
	}
```

## Create a config file
Navigate to `[YourProjectDirectory]/Config`, create a file named `SequenceConfig.ini`, and add the following lines:

```
[/Script/Sequence.Config]

FallbackEncryptionKey = "" 
WaaSConfigKey = "" 
ProjectAccessKey = "" 
GoogleClientID = "" 
AppleClientID = "" 
FacebookClientID = "" 
DiscordClientID = ""
PlayFabTitleID = ""
RedirectUrl = "https://api.sequence.app"
```

## Add your project keys
Fill in `[YourProjectDirectory]/Config/SequenceConfig.ini` with the appropriate values for your project.

`WaaS Config Key` - You can get this key in [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/) under **Onboard > Embedded Wallet**

`Project Access Key` - You can get this key in [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/) under **Settings > API Keys**

`Fallback Encryption Key` - Create a 32-character long alphanumeric encryption key.

:::tip
Make sure to get the WaaS keys from **Production Mode**.

Don't forget to [configure your embedded wallet settings in the Builder](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet/index)!

## Security

In order to prevent tampering with data you must encrypt your packaged project using Unreals packaging settings. You can refer to [these docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/packaging-unreal-engine-projects?application_version=5.3) for more information.

:::tip
You can use a password manager (or any other secure randomness source) to generate this encryption key
:::

:::warning
Only alphanumeric characters are accepted!

**STOP!** Everything on this page is very important! Please double-check that you have done everything!
