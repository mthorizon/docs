# PlayFab

PlayFab sign in via username + password is also supported by our plugin. 

You will need to include your PlayFab Title ID in the `SequenceConfig.ini` file during [Setup](/sdk/unreal/setup#create-a-config-file) and [configure PlayFab in the Builder](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet/playfab-configuration).

## Built-in UI

If you are using the built-in UI, PlayFab sign in is enabled by default. The user can click on the "PlayFab" sign in button on the built-in UI to trigger this flow.

## Custom UI Integration

### New Accounts

If your player doesn't already have an account, you'll want to call `PlayFabRegisterAndLogin` on your UAuthenticator object and provide a username, email, and password. This will create an account for the player with PlayFab and will automatically authenticate them with the Sequence API.

### Existing Accounts

If your player already has an account, you'll want to call `PlayFabLogin` on your UAuthenticator object and provide their username and password. This will authenticate the player with PlayFab and will automatically authenticate them with the Sequence API.

:::tip
Don't forget to [bind to the delegates](/sdk/unreal/authentication/intro#binding-to-the-delegates) for **[AuthSuccess]**, **[AuthFailure]**, **[AuthRequiresCode]** prior to making any signin calls!
