# OIDC - Social Sign In 

Our SDK supports Social Sign In using [OIDC](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) with the [implicit flow](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/oidc-conformant-authentication/oidc-adoption-implicit-flow).

Currently supported OIDC providers include:
- Google -> [Builder Setup](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet/google-configuration)
- Apple -> [Builder Setup](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet/apple-configuration)

:::warning
Stop! Have you configured your OIDC providers in the Builder using the instructions linked above?

Have you added your client id(s) to the `SequenceConfig.ini` file in `[YourProjectDirectory]/Config`? If not, see [Setup](/sdk/unreal/setup#create-a-config-file).
:::

## Built-in UI

If you are using the built-in UI, OIDC sign in is enabled by default. The user can click on the "Google" or "Apple" sign in buttons on the built-in UI to trigger this flow.

## Android Requirements

**Google:** In order to be able to properly use Google Auth, create and place the Keystore file by following [these instructions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/signing-android-projects-for-release-on-the-google-play-store-with-unreal-engine?application_version=5.1).

You will also need to generate an [Android client ID] and a [Web Application client ID] for your application. And place the [Web Application client ID] in the `[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]`, [GoogleClientID] field.

Refer to [these docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/android/get-started#api-console) to generate [Android client ID] and [Web Application client ID].

[This guide](https://https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth?hl=es-419) helps explain how to collect SHA-1 key fingerprints for the [Android client ID].

**Apple:** Please ensure you have a proper [AppleClientID] set in `[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]`

## iOS Requirements

**Google**: Please ensure you have a proper [GoogleClientID] set in `[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]`

**Apple**: Please ensure you have a proper [AppleClientID] set in `[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]`, be sure you register and set your bundle identifier properly for your app

*Apple Specific Requirements*

For Apple sign in to work please be sure to register the [RedirectUrl] in [YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini] appropriately for your app.

## Custom UI Integration 

### Desktop

To start **SSO based authentication** with desktop you will need to navigate to a browser in order to get the necessary id_token.

To get the URL to navigate to you can use the UAuthenticator supplied call `[FString GetSigninURL(const ESocialSigninType& Type)]` where Type is the social login type you wish to use

With whatever implementation you chose you can forward the collected id_token to the UAuthenticator object with `[SocialLogin(const FString& IDTokenIn)]`, after which `[AuthSuccess]` will fire and you're done desktop based SSO.

### Mobile

To start mobile SSO you will need to make use of the `[UAuthenticator::InitiateMobileSSO(const ESocialSigninType& Type)]` where type is the Type of SSO you want to use. IE) Google or Apple, for the time being Discord & Facebook aren't supported. This function call is all that's required for Mobile SSO 

:::tip
Don't forget to [bind to the delegates](/sdk/unreal/authentication/intro#binding-to-the-delegates) for **[AuthSuccess]**, **[AuthFailure]**, **[AuthRequiresCode]** prior to making any signin calls!
