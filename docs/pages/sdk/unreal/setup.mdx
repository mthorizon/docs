ProjectAccessKey = "" 
GoogleClientID = "" 
AppleClientID = "" 
FacebookClientID = "" 
DiscordClientID = ""

RedirectUrl = "https://api.sequence.app"
```

### Add your project keys
Fill in `[YourProjectDirectory]/Config/SequenceConfig.ini` with the appropriate values for your project.

`WaaS Config Key` - You can get this key in [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/) under **Onboard > Embedded Wallet**

`Fallback Encryption Key` - Create a 32-character long alphanumeric encryption key.

## Security

In order to prevent tampering with data you must encrypt your packaged project using Unreals packaging settings. You can refer to [these docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/packaging-unreal-engine-projects?application_version=5.3) for more information.

:::tip
You can use a password manager (or any other secure randomness source) to generate this encryption key
