# Using Sequence's Subsystems

Our Unreal SDK includes a set of Subsystems for seamless Blueprint integration. You can use them in any of your
Blueprints, such as in your Game's User Profile or Login Screen. To handle asynchronous requests, make sure to
assign event listeners to the calls you make.

## Sequence Sessions

Use Sequence's Wallet Subsystem to create and manage user sessions, such as when they sign in with Email or Google.

## Sequence Wallet

Use Sequence's Wallet Subsystem to send transactions or sign messages. Ensure the user has created a session beforehand.

## Sequence Indexer

Use Sequence's Indexer Subsystem to retrieve user information, such as their balance or the tokens they own.
