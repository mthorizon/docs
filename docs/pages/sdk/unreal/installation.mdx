```cpp
    public SequenceTest(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;
		PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore" });
        //The line below is what you want
		PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "SequencePlugin" });
		// Uncomment if you are using Slate UI
		// PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Slate", "SlateCore" });
		// Uncomment if you are using online features
		// PrivateDependencyModuleNames.Add("OnlineSubsystem");
		// To include OnlineSubsystemSteam, add it to the plugins section in your uproject file with the Enabled attribute set to true
	}
```
