# Sequence Wallet

In order to gain access to the SequenceAPI be sure to #include `"Sequence/SequenceAPI.h"` After you've completed initial authentication and have intercepted the credentials either through your UI or ours, to use the **Sequence API** you'll need to create a ```[USequenceWallet*]``` by using:

```cpp
/*
   Automatically tries to read stored credentials on disk and initialize with them
   if none are found returns a TOptional<USequenceWallet*> Pointer without any set Credentials
*/

//USequenceWallet::Get()
const TOptional<USequenceWallet*> WalletOptional = USequenceWallet::Get();
if (WalletOptional.IsSet() && WalletOptional.GetValue())
{
   USequenceWallet * Wallet = WalletOptional.GetValue();
   //Use here
}
```

or

```cpp
/*
   returns a TOptional<USequenceWallet*> Pointer set with the 
   given Credentials
*/

//USequenceWallet::Get(const FCredentials_BE& Credentials)
const TOptional<USequenceWallet*> WalletOptional = USequenceWallet::Get(Credentials);
if (WalletOptional.IsSet() && WalletOptional.GetValue())
{
   USequenceWallet * Wallet = WalletOptional.GetValue();
   //Use here
}
```

or

```cpp
/*
   returns a TOptional<USequenceWallet*> Pointer set with the 
   given Credentials & ProviderUrl
*/

//USequenceWallet::Get(const FCredentials_BE& Credentials,const FString& ProviderUrl);
const TOptional<USequenceWallet*> WalletOptional = USequenceWallet::Get(Credentials,"ProviderUrl");
if (WalletOptional.IsSet() && WalletOptional.GetValue())
{
   USequenceWallet * Wallet = WalletOptional.GetValue();
   //Use here
}
```

Once you have your `[USequenceWallet]` you can feel free to call any of the functions Supplied by the object, as the register call is now automatically done for you.

## USequenceWallet, Static Access & Persistence

`USequenceWallet` is now a Subsystem of `GameInstance`, what this means is not only can you access it from anywhere as if it was a static variable in your C++ code. But it also persists for the lifetime of your game. That is no data is reset when a level is changed in your games!
