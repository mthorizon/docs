# Upgrading from v2 to v3 

## Installation

If you've installed via Package Manager using the git url, please perform the following:

1. Remove Sequence-Unity package
2. Re-install using `https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity.git?path=/Packages/Sequence-Unity` as the link

## Resolving Compile Errors

1. Delete `Samples/Sequence WaaS SDK/version/Setup/Editor` - this is now included in the SDK
2. All namespaces (using statements) that contain `WaaS` have been replaced with `Sequence.EmbeddedWallet`

For example, if you have 
```csharp 
using Sequence.WaaS;
using Sequence.WaaS.Authentication;
using SequenceSDK.WaaS;
```
Replace this with 
```csharp
using Sequence.EmbeddedWallet;
```
3. `WaaSTransactionQueuer` -> `SequenceWalletTransactionQueuer`
4. `WaaSWallet` -> `SequenceWallet`
5. In general, any class, method, or event that contains `WaaS` in the name and gives you a compile error has had `WaaS` removed from its name (with the exception of the few previously mentioned classes)
    Examples:
    `OnWaaSWalletCreated` -> `OnWalletCreated`
    `WaaSSession` -> `Session`
    `EthWallet` -> `EOAWallet`
6. For any existing `LoginPanel` instances
    
    a. Attach the `WaaSSessionManager` prefab (as Session Manager Prefab) under `Sequence > SequenceSDK > EmbeddedWallet > WaaSSessionManager` (if it isnâ€™t already there)
    
    b. Attach the `FederatedAuthPopupPanel` prefab under `Sequence > SequenceFrontend > Prefabs`
