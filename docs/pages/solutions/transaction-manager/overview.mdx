# Transaction Manager

The Sequence Transaction Manager offers a simple interface for dispatching transactions on Ethereum-compatible networks to service your game or app and scale to millions of users that brings an enormous amount of [benefits](/api/transactions/overview#benefits).

One of the most popular is a minting service for creating and minting NFTs to your players, which massively reduces user friction. Below is a setup guide to run this code locally as a minter service, which can be deployable to any infrastructure callable from your own application.

The only difference with respect to deployed EVM contracts: transactions with a Sequence Transaction Manager will have the `msg.sender` as one of the Sequence Relayer addresses, which can be seen in any one of the status pages: for example [here on mainnet](https://mainnet-relayer.sequence.app/status) with the `senders` array.


## Quickstart

::::steps

#### Run on your own Local Server 

To spin up a quick boilerplate that leverages the Transaction Manager code, you can run the following command from your terminal to install the Sequence-CLI and create a nodejs app, listening on port `3001`:

```shell
npx sequence-cli boilerplates create-tx-manager
```

Follow the prompts, with the included variables and steps below.

#### Sequence Builder Project Management

Create a project using this [walkthrough](/solutions/builder/getting-started).

What network you choose should be passed into the HTTP call for `chainHandle`. 

See [Chain Support](/solutions/technical-references/chain-support) for available networks.

#### Access Key Management

Obtain a Project Access Key using this [walkthrough](/solutions/builder/getting-started#claim-an-api-access-key).

This should be used for `PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY`.

#### Generate Private Key for Transactions API

Generate an Ethereum private key as an Externally Owned Account (EOA) passed into a Relayer Wallet. For demo purposes you can obtain a private key from [here](https://sequence-ethauthproof-viewer.vercel.app/).

#### Deploy an ERC1155 or ERC721 Collectible Contract

Deploy a collectible contract by following this [walkthrough](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-an-item-collection).

This contract should be used for `contractAddress` in the `cURL` call below, noting to include a `tokenID` if it's an `ERC1155`.

#### Set a `Minter Role` on the Contract

Navigate to the `Contracts` page in the Sequence Builder and under `Write Contract` tab expand the `grantRole` method. Complete with the following details:

* bytes32 role: `0x9f2df0fed2c77648de5860a4cc508cd0818c85b8b8a1ab4ceeef8d981c8956a6`
* address account: `<Generated Wallet Address from Step 4>`

#### Perform Mint Transaction

Using a command line interface, call using cURL to mint to a wallet address:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/mint \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"evmAddress": "<EVM_WALLET_ADDRESS>", "chainHandle":"<CHAIN_HANDLE>","tokenID": "<TOKEN_ID_IF_ERC1155>", "contractAddress":"<COLLECTIBLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>", "isERC1155": <true_OR_false>, "amount":<AMOUNT> }'
```

Input an `EVM wallet address`, `token ID`, `chain handle`, `collectible contract address` (either a Sequence Builder ERC721 or ERC1155), `true` or `false` for `isERC1155`, and the `amount` of tokens to transfer into the above request and mint!

You should recieve a response with a `txHash`:

```shell
{"txHash":"<TX_HASH>"}
```

The Transaction Manager boilerplate will accept requests from all origins.

## Boilerplate Source Code

Want to further customize and take your code to production? There's a single step to make this production ready for Web applications:

### Restrict Origin from a Frontend Code

Update the following line of code from `*` to include the `requesting origin domain` of the deployed application in the following [line of code.](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/tx-manager-boilerplate/blob/master/server/server.ts#L44)

:::info
Get started quickly with the source code of the [boilerplate](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/tx-manager-boilerplate) using the Transactions API by extending the codebase. For example: to incorporate batch transactions, offer ERC20 airdrops, and more.
