# Onboard with Sequence

Sequence offers multiple wallet options to integrate into your products. We have two main options: the Embedded Wallet and the Universal Wallet. Both are completely non-custodial.

The Embedded Wallet is designed for a traditional gaming experience. It operates without intrusive pop-ups, modals, or transaction signing that might distract players. Users can easily log in using common social logins or other authentication methods and dive straight into the game. We support popular game engines like Unreal and Unity, as well as Typescript for seamless integration into your preferred framework.

On the other hand, the Universal Wallet targets native blockchain users, particularly those involved in gaming and gaming assets. It provides a familiar environment for existing blockchain users and enables developers to create compelling web3 experiences. The [Typescript SDK](/sdk/typescript/guides/overview) makes integration straightforward.

As for the benefits, both wallets offer non-custodial smart contract wallets with advantages like gasless transactions. If you prioritize a smooth, web2/2.5-like experience, the Embedded Wallet is the way to go. For a focus on web2.5/web3 native users, the Universal Wallet is recommended.

Furthermore, our [Sequence Kit](/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/overview) wallet connector merges both options into a customizable UI written in Typescript, tailored for a browser experience. This allows you to cater to users with existing wallets like Metamask, as well as millions of potential new users who prefer the convenience of social login.

Lastly, we provide [Wallet Linking](/solutions/wallets/link-wallets/overview) which enables the ability for a developer to create a verifiable association between two wallets from a single user. Generally, this is a link between an embedded wallet for a game or application and an external wallet, such as Metamask so you can easily query all wallets associated with a single user - across games, ecosystems, and blockchains.
