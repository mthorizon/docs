# Wallet

Sequence Universal Wallet gives you a friendly, non-custodial wallet for your users with multi-chain support and seamless integration with a focus on web2.5 or web3 users.

Most wallets for Ethereum have a single private key that has full control over a wallet, i.e. an Externally Owned Account (EOAs).
However, a Sequence wallet is a Smart Contract that is deployed on the blockchain and which can be controlled by multiple private keys.
These keys are meant to be controlled by the wallet owner and provide added security since more than one of these keys would need to be
compromised for the wallet to be compromised.

Check out how to integrate our Universal Wallet via our [Sequence Builder Console](/solutions/builder/wallet-sdks) or continue with our [Quickstart](/solutions/wallets/universal-wallet/quickstart) guide to integrate with Sequence Universal Wallet via our SDK package.
