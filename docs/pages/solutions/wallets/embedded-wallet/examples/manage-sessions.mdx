# Session Management

Sequence Auth and Embedded Wallet handles the following aspects of your application:

- [Account Management](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/manage-sessions#account-management): Manage blockchain accounts to sign up or sign in users.
- [Authenticating Accounts](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/manage-sessions#authenticating-accounts): Authentication sessions to return important details to be consumed by your application to enhance the experience of games and applications.
- [Session Management](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/manage-sessions#managing-sessions): Manage the listing and dropping of sessions handled by the WaaS stack.

This means you don't need to implement an account system yourself; instead, you interact with the Auth + WaaS SDK whenever you need to authenticate a user.

## Account Management

### Sign Up / Sign In

Signing in and signing up are the same operation; the account is automatically created if it doesn't already exist.

```ts
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'

const sequence = new SequenceWaaS({
  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.VITE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,
  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.VITE_WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,
  network: 'arbitrum-nova'
})

// Get a sessionHash
const sessionHash = await sequence.getSessionHash()

// Get an idToken using the social auth provider of your choice
// (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
// Note: remember to pass the sessionHash as a nonce!

// Then sign in with Sequence WaaS
const res = await sequence.signIn({ idToken }, "MacBook Pro - Chrome")

console.log(res)
```

```json
{
  "sessionId": "0x63A21cCa14ed7454B9cF6466af422B5c597c6b57",
  "wallet": "0xd6043fe6f06d90ec2cB36cA5CD1B193A8515f350",
}
```

:::note
Sessions opened with some providers might require a second step in order to be usable for sending transactions.

## Authenticating Accounts

### Email Sign In / Sign Up

The Embedded Wallet SDK can enable developers to accept any @domain email and initiate an Embedded Wallet session based on the successful answer of a One-Time Password. The feature enables:

- **Direct Email Support**: The SDK supports email sign-in when the key is generated with email scope.
- **Secure User Flow**: After providing a user email, the Embedded Wallet Nitro API sends a One-Time Password (OTP) to this email.
- **Authentication**: Enter the One-Time Password into the SDK to obtain an user wallet.

```ts
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'

const sequence = new SequenceWaaS({
  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.VITE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,
  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.VITE_WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,
  network: 'arbitrum-nova'
})

sequence.onEmailAuthCodeRequired(async (respondWithCode: any) => {
  // you can now store the `respondWithCode` callback somewhere and call it when user submits the code from email
  // it may return error and be retried for maximum 3 times, while this is happening the promise returned from `signIn` is still pending
  await respondWithCode(otpCode)
})

const emailResponse = await sequence.signIn({ email })
```
```json
{
  "sessionId": "0x63A21cCa14ed7454B9cF6466af422B5c597c6b57",
  "wallet": "0xd6043fe6f06d90ec2cB36cA5CD1B193A8515f350",
  "email": "email@domain"
}
```

### Google / Apple Auth
**Integrate Google and Apple Authentication:**

- **Support Authentication**: The SDK directly supports Google and Apple authentication.
- **Open Sessions**: Open sessions using idTokens obtained from the social auth providers.
- **Explore Examples**: Start with a main.tsx file to set up the WaaS SDK, router, and Google OAuth provider. For more details, view the repository and functional [demo-waas-auth](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-waas-auth).

Begin with a simple `main.tsx` file that sets up the WaaS SDK, the router, and the Google OAuth provider.

```ts
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'
import { GoogleOAuthProvider } from '@react-oauth/google'
import { createHashRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom'

const sequence = new SequenceWaaS({
  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.VITE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,
  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.VITE_WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,
  network: 'arbitrum-nova'
})

export const router = createHashRouter([
  {
    path: '/login',
    element: <Login />
  },
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <App />
  }
])

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
      <GoogleOAuthProvider clientId={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}>
        <RouterProvider router={router} />
      </GoogleOAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

**Manage Session Security with Hooks:**
- **Use `useSessionHash` Hook**: Implement this hook to obtain a session hash, enhancing security by preventing replay attacks.
- **Retrieve Session Hash**: Utilize **`sequence.getSessionHash`** to acquire the current session hash.
- **Handle State Changes**: Apply **`sequence.onSessionStateChanged`** to update the session hash whenever the session state changes.

```ts
import { sequence } from './main'
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export function useSessionHash() {
    const [sessionHash, setSessionHash] = useState("")
    const [error, setError] = useState<any>(undefined)

    useEffect(() => {
        const handler = async () => {
            try {
                setSessionHash(await sequence.getSessionHash())
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error)
                setError(error)
            }
        }
        handler()
        return sequence.onSessionStateChanged(handler)
    }, [setSessionHash, setError])

    return {
        sessionHash,
        error,
        loading: !!sessionHash,
    }
}
```

**Implement Google Login:**
- **Integrate GoogleLogin Component**: Use the **`GoogleLogin`** component from the **`@react-oauth/google`** package for Google authentication.
- **Login Event Handling**: Trigger the **`handleGoogleLogin`** function when a user successfully logs into Google.

Make sure to re-render the component whenever `sessionHash` changes to avoid hard-to-track discrepancy errors. For example, you can use the `key` attribute to force the re-render.

```ts
import { router, sequence } from './main'
import { CredentialResponse, GoogleLogin } from '@react-oauth/google'
import { useSessionHash } from "./useSessionHash.ts";

function Login() {
  const { sessionHash } = useSessionHash()
  const [signingIn, setSigningIn] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      if (await sequence.isSignedIn()) {
        router.navigate('/')
      }
    })()
  }, [])

  const handleGoogleLogin = async (tokenResponse: CredentialResponse) => {
    const walletAddress = await sequence.signIn({
      idToken: tokenResponse.credential!
    }, "MacBook Pro - Chrome")

    console.log(`Wallet address: ${walletAddress}`)
    router.navigate('/')
  }

  return (
    {!!sessionHash && (<>
      <GoogleLogin onSuccess={handleGoogleLogin} shape="circle" width={230} />
    </>)}
 )
}

export default Login
```

### Check if a User is Signed-In

A user session can be checked to see if they are logged in with the following function call:

```ts
if (await sequence.isSignedIn()){
  ... // logged in
} else {
  ... // not logged in
}
```

### `idToken` JWT Parsing

Based on the way that your application is configured from perspective of the Authentication Providers, you have the option to parse user details that can be shared with applications to be integrated in some way. 

For example, as a simple way to create social inclusion of profiling in your experience, you can reference Profile photos used already within the respective ecosystems: Google & Apple.

The following are details included in the returned JWT's:

#### Google JWT Parsing `idToken` Contents
- `iss` (aka Issuer) (string) - The issuer of the token. For tokens from Google, this is usually a URL like https://accounts.google.com or something similiar.
- `azp` (aka Authorized party) (string) - The client ID of the authorized presenter. This claim is used in Google OAuth 2.0 to identify the party using the token.
- `aud` (aka Audience) (string) - Intended audience of the token. Typically, this is your application's client ID.
- `sub` (aka Subject) (string) - The unique identifier for the user. It is intended to be used to identify the user across multiple systems.
- `hd` (aka Hosted Domain) (string) - It means that the user who has authenticated is from the respective domain.
- `email` (string) - The user's email address, as registered in the authentication service.
- `email_verified` (boolean) (string) - A boolean representing whether the email address has been verified as genuine.
- `nonce` (string) - A string used to associate a client session with an ID token and to mitigate replay attacks.
- `name` (string) - The full name of the user as registered in the authentication service.
- `picture` (string) - URL of the user's profile picture.
- `given_name` (string) - The user's first name.
- `family_name` (string) - The user's last name.
- `iat` (aka Issued at) (number) - The timestamp when the token was issued, represented in Unix time (seconds since Jan 1, 1970).
- `exp` (aka Expiration time) (number) - The expiration timestamp of the token, beyond which the token should not be considered valid.

#### Apple JWT Parsing `idToken` Contents
- `iss` (string) - The issuer registered claim identifies the principal that issues the identity token. Because Apple generates the token, the value is https://appleid.apple.com.
- `sub` (string) - The subject registered claim identifies the principal thatâ€™s the subject of the identity token. Because this token is for your app, the value is the unique identifier for the user.
- `aud` (string) - The audience registered claim identifies the recipient of the identity token. Because the token is for your app, the value is the client_id from your developer account.
- `iat` (number) - The issued at registered claim indicates the time that Apple issues the identity token, in the number of seconds since the Unix epoch in UTC.
- `exp` (number) - The expiration time registered claim identifies the time that the identity token expires, in the number of seconds since the Unix epoch in UTC. The value must be greater than the current date and time when verifying the token.
- `nonce` (string) - A string for associating a client session with the identity token. This value mitigates replay attacks and is present only if you pass it in the authorization request.
- `nonce_supported` (boolean) - A Boolean value that indicates whether the transaction is on a nonce-supported platform. If you send a nonce in the authorization request, but donâ€™t see the nonce claim in the identity token, check this claim to determine how to proceed. If this claim returns true, treat nonce as mandatory and fail the transaction; otherwise, you can proceed treating the nonce as optional.
- `email` (string) - A string value that represents the userâ€™s email address. The email address is either the userâ€™s real email address or the proxy address, depending on their private email relay service. This value may be empty for Sign in with Apple at Work & School users. For example, younger students may not have an email address.
- `email_verified` (string || boolean) - A string or Boolean value that indicates whether the service verifies the email. The value can either be a string ("true" or "false") or a Boolean (true or false). The system may not verify email addresses for Sign in with Apple at Work & School users, and this claim is "false" or false for those users.
- `is_private_email` (string || boolean) - A string or Boolean value that indicates whether the email that the user shares is the proxy address. The value can either be a string ("true" or "false") or a Boolean (true or false).
- `real_user_status` (number) - An Integer value that indicates whether the user appears to be a real person. Use the value of this claim to mitigate fraud. The possible values are: 0 (or Unsupported), 1 (or Unknown), 2 (or LikelyReal). This claim is present only in iOS 14 and later, macOS 11 and later, watchOS 7 and later, tvOS 14 and later. The claim isnâ€™t present or supported for web-based apps.
- `transfer_sub` (string) - A string value that represents the transfer identifier for migrating users to your team. This claim is present only during the 60-day transfer period after you transfer an app.

#### Example JS Code for Parsing

```typescript
function parseJwt(token) {
    try {
        // Split the token into its three parts
        const parts = token.split('.');
        if (parts.length !== 3) {
            throw new Error('JWT token must consist of three parts');
        }

        // The payload is the second part. We decode it from base64 URL encoding.
        const decodedPayload = atob(parts[1].replace(/_/g, '/').replace(/-/g, '+'));

        // Parse the decoded payload as JSON
        const payload = JSON.parse(decodedPayload);

        // Return the payload object, which includes all the claims
        return payload;
    } catch (e) {
        console.error('Failed to parse JWT:', e);
        return null;
    }
}

// Example usage
const token = 'eyJ...'; // Your JWT token here
const jwtDetails = parseJwt(token);

if (jwtDetails) {
    console.log('Email:', jwtDetails.email);
    console.log('Name:', jwtDetails.name);
    console.log('Picture:', jwtDetails.picture);
    // Access other fields similarly
}
```

## Managing Sessions

### List Sessions

This function returns a list of sessions for the current user and only includes sessions that are still valid.

```ts
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'

const sequence = new SequenceWaaS({
  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.VITE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,
  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.VITE_WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,
  network: 'arbitrum-nova'
})

await sequence.signIn({ idToken }, "MacBook Pro - Chrome")

const sessions = await sequence.listSessions()
console.log(sessions)
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": "0x574372ff1A0Eede68B5358Cce7bbb93155A9dfe0",
    "address": "0x574372ff1a0eede68b5358cce7bbb93155a9dfe0",

]
```

### Close Session

A session can be closed using the `id` of the session. Any session can be closed from any device with an active session.

```ts
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'

const sequence = new SequenceWaaS({
  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.VITE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,
  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.VITE_WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,
  network: 'arbitrum-nova'
})

await sequence.signIn({ idToken }, "MacBook Pro - Chrome")

const sessions = await sequence.listSessions()
await sequence.dropSession({ sessionId: sessions[0].id })
```
