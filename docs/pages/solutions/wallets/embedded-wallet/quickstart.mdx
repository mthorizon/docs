# Quickstart

:::info
Looking for [Unity](/sdk/unity/overview), [Unreal](/sdk/unreal/overview) or [Mobile](/sdk/mobile)? We have you covered with our dedicated SDKs.
:::

::::steps
### Clone Starter Repo
Run the following from your terminal to clone the starter repo.

:::code-group
```bash [React]
npx sequence-cli boilerplates create-embedded-wallet-react-starter
```

```bash [Next]
npx sequence-cli boilerplates create-kit-embedded-wallet-nextjs-starter
```


### Copy example .env file

```bash
cd embedded-wallet-react-boilerplate && cp .env.example .env
```

### Install Packages and start app

:::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

```bash [npm]
npm install && npm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn install && yarn dev
```
:::

### Connect and Authenticate
Navigate to `localhost:4444` and click connect to try out the authentication.


### Use Sequence Embedded Wallets!

Now that you have a working authentication, you can take look at our examples for the most common functions:
- [Sign messages](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/use-wallets#sign-messages)
- [Send transactions](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/use-wallets#send-transactions)
- [Call contracts](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/use-wallets#call-any-contract)
- [Verify a user on your backend](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/verification#prerequisite-deployment-of-a-parent-wallet)
::::


:::tip
We are using example variables in the .env file, so we recommend creating a project on [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/project/default/wallet/embedded-wallet) and [setting up your own wallet configuration](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet) and update the environment variables to use more social providers for authentication, customize email templates, and more.
:::


Alternatively, the Sequence CLI will run the steps above seamlessly. Simply hit enter after running the command below to use the examples variables or plug in your own from Sequence Builder:
```bash
npx sequence-cli boilerplates create-embedded-wallet-react-starter
```
