# Monetization Overview

Sequence provides a suite of options to more effectively monetize your blockchain-enabled game like our various **Marketplace** options and **Sequence Pay** - the ultimate toolkit for onboarding users to your game from fiat or crypto.

## Sequence Marketplaces
__White-Label Marketplace__:
Start your browser-based marketplace in minutes, even if you have no coding experience. Customize the marketplace with your branding - choose your fonts, colors, and logos. Our white-label marketplace is perfect for those looking to save time on development, focus on a web-based user experience, and begin selling assets.

__Marketplace APIs__:
Take full control and customize your marketplace with our Marketplace APIs. Build your own UI while we handle the complexity of blockchain and backend orchestration. Use our APIs in game engines like Unity or Unreal to create an in-game marketplace or store. Alternatively, integrate them into a browser-based experience - the choice is yours.

Combine these options as you see fit! Start with a white-label marketplace to sell your initial game assets while developing your game. Then, use our marketplace APIs to showcase and offer these assets in your in-game store. Provide a seamless user experience by keeping everything within the game environment.

### Getting Started
