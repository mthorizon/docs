# Get Started

Signing up and creating a project is easy to do with Sequence Builder and should take you less than a few minutes. In this tutorial, we will help you sign up for Builder and then create your first project.

Let's get started!

## Sign up for Sequence Builder

::::steps

### Go to sequence.build

Go to [Sequence.Build](https://sequence.build/) and click on the `Start Building` or `Sign in` button to get started.

![Sequence builder landing page](/img/builder/builder_landing_page_signup_project.png)

### Choose a sign in method

When you first sign in to Builder, a wallet is created for you.

You may, however, already have a Sequence wallet. If you are signed in with that wallet, you will see an option to use it.

Without a wallet, you will be given a few options to sign in. You can use any of the social sign ins, or you can simply use your email to get started.

![Sequence builder choose signin](/img/builder/builder_choose_signin_signup_project.png)

### Sign in to sequence.build

After choosing how you would like to sign in, you will be presented with the terms of use. To read the `Terms of Use`, `Privacy Policy`, and `Master Services Agreement`, click on the respective links for each.

![Sequence builder accept terms](/img/builder/builder_accept_terms_signup_project.png)

Once you have read each, click through to continue.

You are now signed in to Builder!

## Create a Project

Everything you do in Builder is centered around each project - so let's start one.

The easiest way to start a project is to simply click `+ Create Project`.

![Sequence builder dashboard](/img/builder/builder_dashboard_signup_project.png)

### Enter the project details

A modal will pop up, allowing you to enter details about your project. Provide a project name and, if you like, add an avatar for the project.

Then, select the network(s) on which you would like to start deploying. This can always be changed later.

### Create the project!

Now hit the `Create new Project` button!

Once you finish, you should now be viewing your project dashboard.

### Claim an API Access Key

Finally, to start building you'll need to claim an access key from the Builder, which can be accomplished by navigating to your `project` in the top left corner, selecting `Settings` in the side nav, and selecting the `API Access Keys` card

![open project settings](/img/builder/builder_open_access_key_settings.png)

Within the `settings` of the `API Access Keys` select the `dev` access key, which is typically used for development environments, whereas the `prod` key is used for production envrionments for applications in front of your users.

Finally copy the key from the settings by selecting the `copy`

![copy access key](/img/builder/builder_settings_copy_key.png)

To test it in action, create a js/ts frontend project in your terminal install the following packages

```shell
pnpm install 0xsequence ethers@5.7.2
```

and run the following code from the browser:

```js
import { sequence } from "0xsequence";
const wallet = sequence.initWallet("<access_key>", {
  defaultNetwork: "polygon",
});
const connectDetails = await wallet.connect({ app: "Your app name" });
console.log("=> connected?", connectDetails.connected);
```

### (Optional for Development) Create a Service Account

In order to integrate some services from the Sequence stack, a Service Account has to be created to make updates or read from state - including [Collections API](/guides/metadata-guide) or [Webhooks](/api/indexer/examples/webhook-listener) - a `Secret API Key` is required.

One can navigate to the API Access Keys section by selecting the project, accessing the sidebar nav page of `Settings`, and selecting the `API Access Keys` card

![open project settings](/img/builder/builder_open_access_key_settings.png)

And scroll to the bottom, where you will find the `Secret API Access Key(s)` section 

Where you would select `+ Add Service Account`

![secret API keys](/img/builder/builder_service_accounts_create_secret_api_key.png)

And either create a `Read` key, or, a `Write` secret API access key. 

For making updates to the Sequence system, select `Write` and `+ Add Service Account` to include in your integration.

![create a write key](/img/builder/builder_service_accounts_create_write_key.png)

Copy the JWT token and save it somewhere safe, or, in your project 

<Callout type="warning">
  Warning: You won't have access to the generated `Secret API Access Key` in the future from the Builder interface, make sure to save it somewhere safe.
</Callout>

## Build things!

Now that you have created a project and claimed an API Access key, there is so much you can do from here.

If you feel like it, begin with one of these examples:
