# Analytics in Sequence Builder

When you use Sequence, via our SDKs, to build your application, you can see key insights in Sequence Builder. 
You don't need to do any additional work to see valuable metrics about your project, such as the number
of connected wallets or daily transaction requests.

#### How it works

When requests are made with Sequence SDKs/APIs, analytics events are fired and sent to our internal analytics system, Databeat.
Databeat anonymizes the data and stores it in a secure database designed for high-volume, real-time applications. The metrics you see in Builder are 
queried from the database, in real-time, for your project and presented in insightful visualizations. 

## Overview

In the Overview tab of Builder, you will see the key, high-level metrics for your project. Metric cards will show the total value for that metric, and
clicking on one will change the chart to show time-series data for that metric.

You also have the option to look back at your data beyond the default **Last 30 days** 
by toggling the filter in the top right corner.
