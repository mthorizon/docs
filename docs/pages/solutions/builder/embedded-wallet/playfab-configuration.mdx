### Create a New Studio 

After you've signed in, go to the [following link to create a studio](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/r/studio/new) which will generate a `Title ID` for you.

### Retrieve a Title ID

Afer you've created a studio, you can retrieve the `Title ID` to include it in the SDK on the [following page](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/my-games)

Then add the Title ID to your [Embedded Wallet configuration](https://sequence.build/project/default/wallet/embedded-wallet) as a new login provider which will complete the configuration.

The configuration is complete! Lastly, check out our reference implementation for web to see how to [retrieve the Playfab ticket](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/authentication#authenticating-with-playfab) and pass it to Sequence to authenticate the user.
