# Guest Wallet Configuration for Embedded Wallet

Guest Wallets are a feature in the Sequence Stack that allow for ephemeral creation of an authentication idenity that lasts till the user clears their browser cache, or, sign's in again.

This strategy for onboarding can be useful for providing ways to freely access your game or experience, increasing your conversion rate until players want to persist their information.

Importantly, if users clear their cache or lose access to the device - any assets in the Guest Wallet will not be recoverable. Therefore, users should connect an additional authentication method if any value is associated with the wallet.

<Callout type="warning">
The Guest Wallet feature is currently in early access. To enable it, please visit https://sequence.build/earlyaccess and turn on the functionality.
