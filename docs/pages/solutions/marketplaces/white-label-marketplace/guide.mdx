#### Sequence Market
This marketplace type enables users to create custom listings and offers on a decentralized orderbook, available for anyone to partake in commerce, allowing for time expiry of orders, custom pricing, and ERC20 custom currency types, as well as other features.

#### P2P
This marketplace type sources from various marketplaces on the internet, like Opensea, Blur, Magic Eden, LooksRare, SudoSwap, NFTX, etc. For this marketplace type, there is no custom currency.

#### AMM 
This marketplace type enables users to trade ERC1155 tokens using the Niftyswap protocol, which creates liquidity pools with any ERC20 token through an Automated Market Maker (AMM) mechanism.

### Add a Custom Currency

Add a currency to transact with on the marketplace, by first accessing settings for a collectible
