# Metadata API Endpoints and Schema

For secret endpoints, you will need to create a [Sequence service token](/guides/metadata-guide/#1-obtain-a-secret-api-key) with write access and pass that as a `Bearer Token` in the API Request. Otherwise, public endpoints will require your project access key to be passed as a header.
