# How to sell On-Chain Items in your Unreal Project

Accelerate your game growth by selling items directly to your players. In this guide, we will go over the steps how
to deploy a Primary Sale contract using any custom or existing currency for an In-Game Shop that utilizes game items
from a ERC1155 contract. We will use the following technologies from the Sequence platform:

- [Primary Sales Contract](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-primary-sales-contract/): How to set up and deploy contracts for launching a primary sale — suitable for an Web Shop, NFT Drop, and more.
- [Embedded Wallet](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/overview): Use Sequence Kit and Sequence Embedded Wallet to authenticate a user.
- [Sequence Indexer](solutions/builder/indexer): Leveraging the Sequence Indexer to query NFT metadata and user's wallet assets.

## 1. Deploy your own Token- and Sale Contract in Sequence Builder

In the builder you have to create your own token contract and a sale contract specific to your
We first need a Primary Sales Contract along with an ERC1155 contract that will contain our game items we want to sell.
To do that, please follow the [guide](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-primary-sales-contract) here.

## 2. Use the Primary Sales Boilerplate

To get started, clone the [Primary Sale Unreal Boilerplate](https://github.com/0xsequence/unreal-primary-sale-boilerplate) and run the Unreal Project.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/0xsequence/unreal-primary-sale-boilerplate.git
```

Then, navigate to the `UPrimarySaleWindowBP.cpp` widget which serves as a good reference to how it's integrated.

## 3. Set your Sale Configurations in your Project

To configure your sale, open the `BP_PrimarySalesWindow` Boilerplate and locate the following Blueprint functions:

- SetTokenContractAddress: Enter the token contract addresses provided by Sequence's Builder.
- SetSaleContractAddress: Enter the sale contract addresses provided by Sequence's Builder.
- SetItemsForSale: Specify an array of TokenIds (uint64)

## 4. Implement Custom Code to Interact with the SDK

To explain the integration, let's create a custom class to manage the state for our sale.
This class will gather all the necessary data, allowing us to display this information to users effectively.

```cpp
void UPrimarySaleWindowBP::NativeConstruct()
{
	RefreshStateButton->OnClicked.AddDynamic(this, &UPrimarySaleWindowBP::OnRefreshStateClicked);
	ShowQrCodeButton->OnClicked.AddDynamic(this, &UPrimarySaleWindowBP::OnShowQrCodeClicked);

	this->RefreshState();
}
```

## 5. Retrieve Your Primary Sale Details

Next, use the `UERC1155Sale.h` reference to obtain sale details and the payment token from the contract.
This information can be used, for instance, to locally verify if the user has sufficient balance for the specified payment token.

```csharp

```

## 6. Fetching Token Metadata to Display Items to Users

We’ll use the Indexer API to retrieve token supplies for the specified token contract address.
Be sure to use the address of the ERC1155 contract, not the sales contract.

```csharp
FString TokenContractAddress;
TArray<int64> TokenIds;
TArray<FSeqTokenMetaData> Metadata;

void USequenceWalletBP::UpdateTokenSupplies(TArray<int64> TokenIds)
{
	TOptional<USequenceWallet*> WalletOptional = USequenceWallet::Get();
	USequenceWallet* Wallet = WalletOptional.GetValue();
	FString WalletAddress = Wallet->GetWalletAddress();

	TArray<FSeqTokenMetaData> Metadata;

	FSeqGetTokenSuppliesArgs TokenSupplyArgs;
	TokenSupplyArgs.contractAddress = TokenContractAddress;
	TokenSupplyArgs.includeMetaData = true;

	Wallet->GetTokenSupplies(TokenSupplyArgs, [this](const FSeqGetTokenSuppliesReturn Supplies)
	{
		for (auto TokenSupply : Supplies.tokenIDs)
		{
			if (this->TokenIds.Contains(TokenSupply.tokenID))
			{
				this->Metadata.Push(TokenSupply.tokenMetaData);
			}
		}
	}, [](FSequenceError Error)
	{
		UE_LOG(LogTemp, Display, TEXT("%s"), *Error.Message);
	});
}
```

## 7. Purchase an Item from the Store

This will call the mint function from the Sales Contract. By specifying the user’s wallet address as the `to` parameter,
the contract will mint the item to that user. You can use the `UERC1155SaleContract.h` class to create a `FRawTransaction`
reference, which allows you to send a transaction to your sales contract using the user's wallet.

```cpp
FString SaleContractAddress;
FString PaymentToken;

void USequenceWalletBP::PurchaseItem(int32 TokenId, int32 Amount)
{
	TOptional<USequenceWallet*> WalletOptional = USequenceWallet::Get();
	USequenceWallet* Wallet = WalletOptional.GetValue();
	FString WalletAddress = Wallet->GetWalletAddress();

	TArray<int32> TokenIds;
	TokenIds.Push(TokenId);

	TArray<int32> Amounts;
	Amounts.Push(Amount);

	TArray<FString> Proof;
    Proof.Add("");

	UERC1155SaleContract SaleContract = UERC1155SaleContract(SaleContractAddress, PaymentToken, 1, 0);
	FRawTransaction Transaction = SaleContract.MakePurchaseTransaction(WalletAddress, TokenIds, Amounts, Proof);

	Wallet->SendRawTransaction(Transaction, [](const FUnsizedData Result)
	{
		// Decode the result
	}, [](const FSequenceError* Error)
	{
		UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("%s"), *Error.Message);
	});
}
```
