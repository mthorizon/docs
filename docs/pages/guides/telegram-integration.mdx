# How to Integrate Sequence Embedded Wallets with your Telegram Mini-app or Telegram game

We'll be walking through how to integrate a sequence embedded wallet into your Telegram game or app and authenticate your users via email.

## Clone the Telegram Boilerplate

<TabbedContent labels={["Github", "Github Template"]}>
    <div className="tabbed-content__content">

        #### You can clone Primary Sales Repository from Github

        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/0xsequence/primary-drop-sale-1155-boilerplate.git
        ```

        <br/>

        Then install and run:

        <br/>

        ```shell
        pnpm install && pnpm dev
        ```

        <br/>

        After you install the dependencies, `.env.example` will be automatically copied to `.env`, so you can test things out with pre-provided keys.

        <br/>

        When you're ready, replace the contents of `.env` with your project's information.

    </div>

        #### You can use the Primary Sales Repository Template from Github

        Go to https://github.com/0xsequence/primary-drop-sale-1155-boilerplate and click "Use this Template" in the top right corner.
        <br/>

        Clone your newly made repo.

        <br/>

        Then install and run:

        <br/>

        ```shell
        pnpm install && pnpm dev
        ```

        <br/>
        After you install the dependencies, `.env.example` will be automatically copied to `.env`, so you can test things out with pre-provided keys.
        <br/>

        When you're ready, replace the contents of `.env` with your project's information.

### Bot Setup and Auth Token

- Open the Telegram app then in the search bar type **BotFather** and select the verified account.
- Click on **Start** or type `/start` to initiate a conversation with BotFather.
- Type `/newbot` and press Enter.
- Follow the prompts to provide a name and a unique username for your bot.
  - The bot's name can be anything, but the username must end in `bot` (e.g., `Sequence_Example_bot`).
- Once your bot is created, BotFather will send a message with your **HTTP API Token**.
  - The token will look something like this: `123456789:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`.

### Set the Sales Configurations for the project.

Once we have our sales contract deployed, we'll simply update the sales configuration on the boilerplate. Go to `src/salesConfigs.ts` and modify the salesConfigs variable by adding each contract sale in an array for your project with the networks you want to support. Example:

```ts
export const salesConfigs: SaleConfiguration[] = [
  {
    nftTokenAddress: "0x888a322db4b8033bac3ff84412738c096f87f9d0",
    salesContractAddress: "0x0327b2f274e04d292e74a06809bcd687c63a4ba4",
    chainId: 80002, //polygonAmoy
    // Modify here to show different items
    itemsForSale: ["0", "1"],
  },
  {
    nftTokenAddress: "0xd4bb59d0ba1f7b2beea4c6d9b9f151ee1da02665",
    salesContractAddress: "0x326d2fbe4808dd2a3e205aecc5e25a6322ad0a81",
    chainId: 421614, //arbitrumSepolia,
    // Modify here to show different items
    itemsForSale: ["0"],
  },
];
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can see all the available chains currently supported by sequence <a href="/solutions/technical-references/chain-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>here</a>.
</Callout>

### Set a default chainId for the project.

To set the default chainId, go to `src/salesConfigs.ts` and modify the defaultChainId variable with the chainId you want to display by default in the project. It must match a chainId present in your salesConfigs variable. For example:

```ts
// In this case, the chosen `defaultChainId` is 80002 (amoy), which is present in the previously declared `salesConfigs` variable.
export const defaultChainId = 80002;
```

### Done!

Your primary sales should now appear and function correctly from this point onward. In order to make a purchase, ensure you have the corresponding token that you set as a currency for the sale in your wallet, increment the amount, and click purchase!
