# Primary Sales

In this guide, we will go through the process of creating a Primary Sales contract using a few simple tools from the Sequence stack.

1. [Primary Sales Contract](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-primary-sales-contract/): How to set up and deploy contracts for launching a primary sale â€” suitable for an NFT drop, in-game store, and more.
2. [Embedded Wallet](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/overview): Use Sequence Kit and Sequence WaaS to authenticate a user.

## You can easily clone the Primary Sales repository using your credentials with the Sequence CLI

### If you don't have Sequence CLI follow this step

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm add -g sequence-cli

# npm
npm install -g sequence-cli

# yarn
yarn global add sequence-cli
```

### When you already have Sequence Cli in your machine run

```bash
npx sequence-cli marketplace (coming soon)
```

## You can clone Primary Sales Repository from Github

```shell
git clone https://github.com/0xsequence/primary-drop-sale-boilerplate/
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill with your project information. To test things out, you can use the pre-provided keys in the `.env.example` file:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Be sure your .env file has been created in the root of your project to include client secrets
</Callout>

Then install and run:

```shell
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

## Once you have the project installed and running you can use your own Primary Sales Contract there following the next steps

::::steps
### Step 1: Deploy a Primary Sales Contract in Sequence Builder

To do that follow this [guide](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-primary-sales-contract)

### Step 2: Set the chains where your primary sales contracts are deployed.

To place available chains you should go to "src/views/constants/index.ts" and create new varibles for each chainId for your project. Example:

```ts
export const CHAIN_ID_AMOY = 80002;
export const CHAIN_ID_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA = 421614;
```

Now go to path "src/utils/primarySellHelpers.tsx" and modify the getChainId function with your chains and the default return. Example:

```ts
import {
  CHAIN_ID_AMOY,
  CHAIN_ID_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA,
} from "../views/constants";

export function getChainId(chainId: number | undefined): number {
  switch (chainId) {
    case CHAIN_ID_AMOY:
      return CHAIN_ID_AMOY;
    case CHAIN_ID_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA:
      return CHAIN_ID_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA;
    default:
      return CHAIN_ID_AMOY;
  }
}
```

</Callout>

### Step 3: Set your primary sales contracts deployed into the project.

To place your Contract Sales into the project you should go to "src/views/constants/index.ts" and create new varibles for each Sales Contract for your project. Example:

```ts
export const SALES_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_AMOY =
  "0x0327b2f274e04d292e74a06809bcd687c63a4ba4";
export const SALES_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA =
  "0x326d2fbe4808dd2a3e205aecc5e25a6322ad0a81";
```
Now go to path "src/utils/primarySellHelpers.tsx" and modify the getSalesContractAddress function with your Sales Contract addresses and the default return. Example:

```ts
import {
  CHAIN_ID_AMOY,
  CHAIN_ID_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA,
  SALES_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_AMOY,
  SALES_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA,
} from "../views/constants";

export function getSalesContractAddress(
  chainId: number | undefined,
): `0x${string}` {
  switch (chainId) {
    case CHAIN_ID_AMOY:
      return SALES_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_AMOY;
    case CHAIN_ID_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA:
      return SALES_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA;
    default:
      return SALES_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_AMOY;
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Set your nft token contracts deployed and linked with your primary sales contracts into the project.

To place your Nft Token Contracts into the project you should go to "src/views/constants/index.ts" and create new varibles for each Nft Token Contract for your project. Example:

```ts
export const NFT_TOKEN_ADDRESS_AMOY =
  "0x888a322db4b8033bac3ff84412738c096f87f9d0";
export const NFT_TOKEN_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA =
  "0xd4bb59d0ba1f7b2beea4c6d9b9f151ee1da02665";
```

Now go to the path "src/utils/primarySellHelpers.tsx" and modify the `getNftTokenAddress` function with your NFT token contract addresses and the default return value. Example:

```ts
import {
  CHAIN_ID_AMOY,
  CHAIN_ID_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA,
  NFT_TOKEN_ADDRESS_AMOY,
  NFT_TOKEN_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA,
} from "../views/constants";

export function getNftTokenAddress(chainId: number | undefined): `0x${string}` {
  switch (chainId) {
    case CHAIN_ID_AMOY:
      return NFT_TOKEN_ADDRESS_AMOY;
    case CHAIN_ID_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA:
      return NFT_TOKEN_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA;
    default:
      return NFT_TOKEN_ADDRESS_AMOY;
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Set the token IDs you want to sell for each primary sales contract.

They should not exceed the value of the token IDs you have already created, as a token ID that has not been previously created in the NFT contract will not exist.

To place your token IDs into the project, you should go to src/views/constants/index.ts and create new variables for each token IDs array for your sales in your project. Example:

```ts
export interface SaleItem {
  tokenId: string;
}

export const itemsForSalesAmoy: SaleItem[] = [
  {
    tokenId: "0",
  },
  {
    tokenId: "1",
  },
];

export const itemsForSalesArbitrumSepolia: SaleItem[] = [
  {
    tokenId: "0",
  },
];
```

Now go to the path "src/utils/primarySellHelpers.tsx" and modify the getItemsForSale function with your variables for token IDs and the default return value. Example:

```ts
import {
  CHAIN_ID_AMOY,
  CHAIN_ID_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA,
  itemsForSalesAmoy,
  itemsForSalesArbitrumSepolia,
} from "../views/constants";


export function getItemsForSale(chainId: number | undefined): SaleItem[] {
  switch (chainId) {
    case CHAIN_ID_AMOY:
      return itemsForSalesAmoy;
    case CHAIN_ID_ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA:
      return itemsForSalesArbitrumSepolia;
    default:
      return itemsForSalesAmoy;
  }
}
```

### Final step

Your primary sales should now appear and function correctly from this point onward.
