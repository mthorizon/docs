# Sell your Game Items

In this guide, we will go through the process of creating a Primary Sales project using a few simple tools from the Sequence stack.


1. [Primary Sales Contract](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-primary-sales-contract/): How to set up and deploy contracts for launching a primary sale â€” suitable for an NFT drop, in-game store, and more.
2. [Embedded Wallet](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/overview): Use Sequence Kit and Sequence WaaS to authenticate a user.

<Callout type="info">
  Currently, the boilerplate is compatible with ERC1155 contracts. Compatibility with ERC721 will be added soon.

## Clone the Primary Sales repository

<TabbedContent labels={["Sequence CLI", "Github", "Github Template"]}/>

<div className="tabbed-content__content">

#### You can easily clone the Primary Sales repository using the [Sequence CLI](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-cli/)

```bash
npx sequence-cli boilerplates create-primary-drop-sale-starter
```

</div>
<div className="tabbed-content__content">

#### You can clone Primary Sales Repository from Github

```shell
git clone https://github.com/0xsequence/primary-drop-sale-boilerplate/
```

<br/>

Then install and run:

<br/>

```shell
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

<br/>

After you install the dependencies, `.env.example` will be automatically copied to `.env`, so you can test things out with pre-provided keys.

<br/>

When you're ready, replace the contents of `.env` with your project's information.

</div>

#### You can use the Primary Sales Repository Template from Github

Go to https://github.com/0xsequence/primary-drop-sale-boilerplate and click "Use this Template" in the top right corner.
<br/>

Clone your newly made repo.

<br/>

Then install and run:

<br/>

```shell
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

<br/>

After you install the dependencies, `.env.example` will be automatically copied to `.env`, so you can test things out with pre-provided keys.

<br/>

When you're ready, replace the contents of `.env` with your project's information.

## Set up your own Primary Sales Contracts in the project

Once you have the project installed and running you can use your own Primary Sales Contracts there following the next steps

::::steps
### Step 1: Deploy a Primary Sales Contract in Sequence Builder

To do that follow this [guide](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-primary-sales-contract)

### Step 2: Set the Sales Configurations for the project

To set your own sales configuration, go to `src/utils/primarySells/constants.ts` and modify the salesConfigurations variable by adding each contract sale in an array for your project. Example:

```ts
export const salesConfigurations = [
  {
    networkName: "amoy",
    // NFT Contract address linked to your primary sales contract
    nftTokenAddress: "0x888a322db4b8033bac3ff84412738c096f87f9d0",
    // Primary Sales Contract Address
    salesContractAddress: "0x0327b2f274e04d292e74a06809bcd687c63a4ba4",
    // Chain ID of the contracts
    chainId: 80002,
    // Modify here to show different items
    itemsForSale: [
      {
        tokenId: "0", 
      },
      {
        tokenId: "1",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    networkName: "arbitrum sepolia",
    // NFT Contract address linked to your primary sales contract
    nftTokenAddress: "0xd4bb59d0ba1f7b2beea4c6d9b9f151ee1da02665",
    // Primary Sales Contract Address
    salesContractAddress: "0x326d2fbe4808dd2a3e205aecc5e25a6322ad0a81",
    // Chain ID of the contracts
    chainId: 421614,
    // Modify here to show different items
    itemsForSale: [
      {
        tokenId: "0",
      },
    ],
  },
] as SaleConfigurationProps[];
```

</Callout>

### Step 3: Set a default chain id for the project

To set your own sales configuration, go to `src/utils/primarySells/constants.ts` and modify the `defaultChainId` variable with the default `chainId` you want to display in the project. It must match a `chainId` present in your `salesConfigurations` variable. Example:

```ts
// In this case, the chosen `defaultChainId` is 80002 (amoy), which is present in the previously declared `salesConfigurations` variable.
export const defaultChainId = 80002;
```

### Final step

Your primary sales should now appear and function correctly from this point onward.
