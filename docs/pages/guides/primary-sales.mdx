# Primary Sales

In this guide, we will go through the process of creating a Primary Sales project using a few simple tools from the Sequence stack.


1. [Primary Sales Contract](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-primary-sales-contract/): How to set up and deploy contracts for launching a primary sale â€” suitable for an NFT drop, in-game store, and more.
2. [Embedded Wallet](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/overview): Use Sequence Kit and Sequence WaaS to authenticate a user.

<Callout type="info">
  Currently, the boilerplate is compatible with ERC155 contracts. Compatibility with ERC721 will be added soon.
</Callout>

## You can easily clone the Primary Sales repository using your credentials with the Sequence CLI

### If you don't have Sequence CLI follow this step

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm add -g sequence-cli

# npm
npm install -g sequence-cli

# yarn
yarn global add sequence-cli
```

### When you already have Sequence Cli in your machine run

```bash
npx sequence-cli marketplace (coming soon)
```

## You can clone Primary Sales Repository from Github

```shell
git clone https://github.com/0xsequence/primary-drop-sale-boilerplate/
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill with your project information. To test things out, you can use the pre-provided keys in the `.env.example` file:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Be sure your .env file has been created in the root of your project to include client secrets
</Callout>

Then install and run:

```shell
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

## Once you have the project installed and running you can use your own Primary Sales Contracts there following the next steps

::::steps
### Step 1: Deploy a Primary Sales Contract in Sequence Builder

To do that follow this [guide](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-primary-sales-contract)

### Step 2: Set the Sales Configurations for the project

To set your own sales configuration, go to `src/utils/primarySells/constants.ts` and modify the salesConfigurations variable by adding each contract sale in an array for your project. Example:

```ts
export const salesConfigurations = [
  {
    networkName: "amoy",
    // NFT Contract address linked to your primary sales contract
    nftTokenAddress: "0x888a322db4b8033bac3ff84412738c096f87f9d0",
    // Primary Sales Contract Address
    salesContractAddress: "0x0327b2f274e04d292e74a06809bcd687c63a4ba4",
    // Chain ID of the contracts
    chainId: 80002,
    // Modify here to show different items
    itemsForSale: [
      {
        tokenId: "0", 
      },
      {
        tokenId: "1",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    networkName: "arbitrum sepolia",
    // NFT Contract address linked to your primary sales contract
    nftTokenAddress: "0xd4bb59d0ba1f7b2beea4c6d9b9f151ee1da02665",
    // Primary Sales Contract Address
    salesContractAddress: "0x326d2fbe4808dd2a3e205aecc5e25a6322ad0a81",
    // Chain ID of the contracts
    chainId: 421614,
    // Modify here to show different items
    itemsForSale: [
      {
        tokenId: "0",
      },
    ],
  },
] as SaleConfigurationProps[];
```

</Callout>

### Step 3: Set a default chain id for the project

To set your own sales configuration, go to `src/utils/primarySells/constants.ts` and modify the `defaultChainId` variable with the default `chainId` you want to display in the project. It must match a `chainId` present in your `salesConfigurations` variable. Example:

```ts
// In this case, the chosen `defaultChainId` is 80002 (amoy), which is present in the previously declared `salesConfigurations` variable.
export const defaultChainId = 80002;
```

### Final step

Your primary sales should now appear and function correctly from this point onward.
