# How to build a Game with Unreal Engine

In this guide we will walk you through how to integrate Embedded Wallet features using Sequence's Unreal SDK.
Checkout the [Boilerplate for this guide.](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unreal)

## 1. Setup

::::steps

### Installation

To get started, download the [latest version](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unreal/releases)
of the Sequence SDK and put the `SequencePlugin` folder into your Unreal project's `Plugin` folder.

Alternatively, [learn how to get the SDK from the Epic Games Marketplace.](/sdk/unreal/installation#using-epic-games-marketplace)

### Configure your Project

Now create the `SequenceConfig.ini` file, [based on this format](/sdk/unreal/setup/), in your project's `Config/` directory and include the
WaaS- and Project Key from the [Sequence Builder.](https://sequence.build/) Generate a 32-character encryption key. This key will be used to securely store your user credentials.
The remaining values can be filled in later or whenever new authentication options are needed.

### Include the Built-In UI

Let's build on top of the Pawn `BP_CustomSpectatorPawn` and GameMode `GM_Sequence` included with the SDK by duplicating them into our project.
This will allow us to customize them as needed.

We recommend using the Built-In UI for development purposes, [learn how to create your own UI.](/sdk/unreal/authentication/intro)

::::

## 2. Interact with the SDK
To enable interaction with the Sequence SDK, start by creating a widget blueprint for your project.
Open the Sequence Pawn, locate the `Auth Success` event, and create a reference of your new UserWidget.
Finally, use our subsystems like the `SequenceWalletBP` to access our features from the following sections.

## 3. Display Wallet Information

To display the wallet's address and balance, first retrieve the user's wallet reference.
Then, use it to fetch and display the wallet's address and current balance directly from the connected blockchain.

<b>Example Use Case:</b><br/>Build a UserWidget for your users Web3 profile.

## 4. Sign a Message

To sign a message, first retrieve the user's wallet reference. Then, use the input message from the boilerplate
and initiate the signing process through the wallet to generate the signature.

<b>Example Use Case:</b><br/>You can use this feature to sign a message from your backend, allowing you to verify your user's wallet upon receipt.

## 5. Send Ether to another User

To send an Ether transaction, use the recipient's address and amount from the boilerplate's input fields to initiate
the transaction with the `SequenceWalletBP` subsystem and listen to the response event.

<b>Example Use Case:</b><br/>A user initiates a payment transaction to another user within your game client.
