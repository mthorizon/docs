# Make a Primary Drop Sale via a Web

Accelerate your game’s growth and add excitement by selling placeholders to your players, offering them amazing rewards when the sale period ends, as all placeholders reveal their true features that your players will love. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to deploy a Primary Sale contract using any custom or existing currency for a drop sale that leverages game items from an ERC721 contract. We will use the following technologies from the Sequence platform:

1. [Primary Sales Contract](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-primary-sales-contract/): How to set up and deploy contracts for launching a primary sale — suitable for an Web Shop, NFT Drop, and more.
2. [Embedded Wallet](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/overview): Use Sequence Kit and Sequence Embedded Wallet to authenticate a user.
3. [Sequence Indexer](solutions/builder/indexer): Leveraging the Sequence Indexer to query NFT metadata and user's wallet assets.
4. [Sequence Metadata](/solutions/builder/collections): Updating and managing a collection or token's metadata via the Sequence Builder UI and API.

#### You can easily clone the Primary Sales repository using the [Sequence CLI](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-cli/)

```bash
npx sequence-cli boilerplates create-primary-drop-sale-starter
```

#### You can clone Primary Sales Repository from Github

```shell
git clone https://github.com/0xsequence/primary-drop-sale-721-boilerplate.git
```

<br/>

Then install and run:

<br/>

```shell
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

<br/>

After you install the dependencies, `.env.example` will be automatically copied to `.env`, so you can test things out with pre-provided keys.

<br/>

When you're ready, replace the contents of `.env` with your project's information.

#### You can use the Primary Sales Repository Template from Github

Go to https://github.com/0xsequence/primary-drop-sale-1155-boilerplate and click "Use this Template" in the top right corner.
<br/>

Clone your newly made repo.

Then install and run:

## Configure your own Primary Sales Contracts in the repository

We provide a few example contracts and variables in order to get you started. However, you will likely wnat to use your own contracts. In order to configure this simply following the steps below:

::::steps
### Deploy a Primary Sales Contract in Sequence Builder.

We first need a Primary Sales Contract along with an ERC721 contract that will contain our game items we want to sell. To do that, please follow the [guide](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-primary-sales-contract) here.

### Set the Sales Configurations for the project.

Once we have our sales contract deployed, we'll simply update the sales configuration on the boilerplate. Go to `src/salesConfigs.ts` and modify the salesConfigs variable by adding each contract sale in an array for your project with the networks you want to support. Example:

```ts
export const salesConfigs: SaleConfiguration[] = [
  {
    nftTokenAddress: "0x70a2177079877e4aae639d1abb29ffa537b94970",
    salesContractAddress: "0xa55574c5ed4cd1dbc5feba47a204fdfb483edadd",
    chainId: 80002, //polygonAmoy
  }
];
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can see all the available chains currently supported by sequence <a href="/solutions/technical-references/chain-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>here</a>.
</Callout>

### Set a default chainId for the project.

To set the default chainId, go to `src/salesConfigs.ts` and modify the defaultChainId variable with the chainId you want to display by default in the project. It must match a chainId present in your salesConfigs variable. For example:

```ts
// In this case, the chosen `defaultChainId` is 80002 (amoy), which is present in the previously declared `salesConfigs` variable.
export const defaultChainId = 80002;
```

### Done!

Your primary drop sale should now appear and function correctly from this point onward. In order to make a purchase, ensure you have the corresponding token that you set as a currency for the sale in your wallet, increment the amount, and click purchase!

## How to use this repository

This repository covers three key concepts: first, the creation of placeholders; second, the sale of those placeholders; and finally, the reveal phase, where the placeholders are unveiled, revealing their true characteristics.
