See babel.config.js for the code snippet to update the aliases.(See https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/2250#issuecomment-1321134111 for more details on react-native-quick-crypto alias setup)","title":"Setup shims for ethers and other crypto related packages","titles":["Mobile SDK for Embedded Wallet (React Native)","Integration details"]},"21":{"href":"/sdk/mobile#initialize-sequence-waas","html":"<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">export</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> const</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\"> sequenceWaas</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> new</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\"> SequenceWaaS</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">(</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    network: initialNetwork,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    projectAccessKey: projectAccessKey,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    waasConfigKey: waasConfigKey,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  },</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  localStorage,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">  null</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">  new</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\"> KeychainSecureStoreBackend</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">()</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">);</span></span></code></pre><p>(Check <a href=\"https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-waas-react-native/blob/main/waasSetup.ts\">waasSetup.ts</a> file for more details)</p></div><div data-depth=\"3\">","isPage":false,"text":"export const sequenceWaas = new SequenceWaaS(\n  {\n    network: initialNetwork,\n    projectAccessKey: projectAccessKey,\n    waasConfigKey: waasConfigKey,\n  },\n  localStorage,\n  null,\n  new KeychainSecureStoreBackend()\n);(Check waasSetup.ts file for more details)","title":"Initialize Sequence WaaS","titles":["Mobile SDK for Embedded Wallet (React Native)","Integration details"]},"22":{"href":"/sdk/mobile#signing-in","html":"<p>Once you have an initialized Sequence WaaS instance, you can use it to sign in with email, Google or Apple.

However, in some niche use cases, you may find that you would prefer not to sponsor your users&#x27; transactions. This requires that your users are more experienced Web3 users and have tokens/gas currency in their wallet that can be used to pay gas fees. In addition to the gas currency for the selected network, gas fees can also be paid using select ERC20 and ERC1155 tokens.\nFirst, you&#x27;ll need to assemble the transaction(s) you wish to submit in a batch. Then, you need to request the FeeOptions.\nTransaction[] transactions = new Transaction[]\n{\n    // Create your transactions here\n};\nFeeOptionsResponse response = await _wallet.GetFeeOptions(chain, transactions);\nThe FeeOptionsResponse contains a FeeQuote (string) that locks in the price for each FeeOptionReturn in the FeeOptions array that is returned for a limited time; you&#x27;ll need this in a moment when submitting your transactions. For your convenience, the SDK will automatically query the user&#x27;s wallet to see which of the FeeOptions the user can afford using the Indexer.\nFrom here, you can display a UI to the user to allow them to select how they would like to pay the fee for their transactions.\nOnce the user has selected how they&#x27;d like to pay their fee, you may submit the transactions, including the selected FeeOption and the FeeQuote string.\n_wallet.SendTransactionWithFeeOptions(chain, transactions, response.FeeOptions[selectionIndex].FeeOption, response.FeeQuote);\nIn the Demo Scene that can be imported via Package Manager &gt; Samples, you can see a barebones example usage of FeeOptions.

Generally, this is a link between an embedded wallet for a game or application and an external wallet, such as Metamask so you can easily query all wallets associated with a single user - across games, ecosystems, and blockchains.\n","title":"Onboard with Sequence","titles":[]},"230":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/overview#getting-started","html":"\n<p>Please check out <a href=\"https://sequence.build\">Sequence Builder</a> to create a project and select Wallets to get started.

will return at most one token instance from each contract.\nIn order to fetch ERC721/1155 token balances, you must pass the contractAddress to the GetTokenBalances method.\nThis will return all of the tokens owned by accountAddress from the specified contractAddress.\nSee section below for more information.\n","title":"Fetches list of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens and metadata in any

You may query any contract address on any of the supported networks (but make\nsure to query the indexer of the corresponding network).\nSequence Indexer GetTokenSupplies Method:\n\nRequest: POST /rpc/Indexer/GetTokenSupplies\nContent-Type: application/json\nBody (in JSON):\n\ncontractAddress (string) -- a ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC1155 contract address\nincludeMetadata (boolean - optional - default: false) -- toggle token metadata to be included in the response\nmetadataOptions (object - optional) -- additional options for metadata\n\nverifiedOnly (boolean - optional) -- return only contracts which are &#x27;verified&#x27; to help reduce spam\nincludeContracts ([]string - optional) -- list of specific contract addresses to always be included, even if verifiedOnly is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: GetTokenSupplies of Skyweaver contract on Polygon using an AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY\ncurl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Access-Key: AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY&quot; https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app/rpc/Indexer/GetTokenSupplies -d &#x27;{ &quot;contractAddress&quot;: &quot;0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E&quot;, &quot;includeMetadata&quot;: true }&#x27;// Works in both a Webapp (browser) or Node.js:\nimport { SequenceIndexer } from &#x27;@0xsequence/indexer&#x27;\n \nconst indexer = new SequenceIndexer(&#x27;https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app&#x27;, &#x27;AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY&#x27;)\n \n// here we query the Skyweaver contract address, but you can use any\nconst contractAddress = &#x27;0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E&#x27;\n \n// query Sequence Indexer for all token details / supplies\nconst tokenDetails = await indexer.getTokenSupplies({\n\tcontractAddress: contractAddress,\n\tincludeMetadata: true\n})\nconsole.log(&#x27;token details of contract:&#x27;, tokenDetails)go\nimport (\n\t&quot;context&quot;\n\t&quot;fmt&quot;\n\t&quot;log&quot;\n\t&quot;net/http&quot;\n \n\t&quot;github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence/indexer&quot;\n)\n \nfunc GetTokenSupplies(contractAddress string) {\n\tseqIndexer := indexer.NewIndexer(&quot;https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app&quot;, &quot;AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY&quot;)\n \n\tmetadataOptions := indexer.MetadataOptions{\n\t\tVerifiedOnly:     true, // Set to true if you want to fetch only verified contracts\n\t\tUnverifiedOnly:   false,\n\t\tIncludeContracts: nil, // Provide a list of specific contracts to include, if any\n\t}\n \n\t_, _, tokenDetails, err := seqIndexer.GetTokenSupplies(context.Background(), contractAddress, nil, &amp;metadataOptions, nil)\n\t\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n \n\tfmt.Println(&quot;token details:&quot;, tokenDetails)\n}","title":"Fetch all unique tokens in a particular ERC20/721/1155 contract, including total supplies","titles":["Tokens in a contract",null]},"263":{"href":"/api/marketplace/examples/get-user-activities#getuseractivities","html":"\n<p>Enables you to retrieve activity data for a specific user, including orders and trades.

Ethereum mainnet\nconst wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey);\n \n// If your dapp runs on a different EVM-compatible blockchain, you can specify its name\n// const wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey, { defaultNetwork: &#x27;polygon&#x27; });\nNote that is possible to retrieve the above instance by using the getWallet() method:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\nOnce you have the instance, you can connect to the wallet:\nconst connectDetails = await wallet.connect({\n  app: &quot;Your Dapp name&quot;,\n  authorize: true,\n  // And pass settings if you would like to customize further\n  settings: {\n    theme: &quot;light&quot;,\n    bannerUrl: &quot;https://yoursite.com/banner-image.png&quot;, // 3:1 aspect ratio, 1200x400 works best\n    includedPaymentProviders: [&quot;moonpay&quot;, &quot;ramp&quot;],\n    defaultFundingCurrency: &quot;matic&quot;,\n    lockFundingCurrencyToDefault: false,\n  },\n});\n \nconsole.log(&quot;user accepted connect?&quot;, connectDetails.connected);\nconsole.log(\n  &quot;users signed connect proof to valid their account address:&quot;,\n  connectDetails.proof\n);\nYou can pick/limit the available sign in options with signInOptions. Will be ignored if user is already signed in.\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\n \nawait wallet.connect({\n  app: &quot;Your Dapp name&quot;,\n  settings: { signInOptions: [&quot;google&quot;] },\n});\nAfter you connect, you can use wallet.openWallet() to open the wallet:\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\nwallet.openWallet();\nYou can also optionally pass a path, and use openWithOptions intent to pass settings when you open the wallet:\nconst settings: Settings = {\n  theme: &quot;dark&quot;,\n  bannerUrl: &quot;https://yoursite.com/banner-image.png&quot;, // 3:1 aspect ratio, 1200x400 works best\n  includedPaymentProviders: [&quot;moonpay&quot;, &quot;ramp&quot;],\n  defaultFundingCurrency: &quot;eth&quot;,\n  lockFundingCurrencyToDefault: false,\n};\n \nconst intent: OpenWalletIntent = {\n  type: &quot;openWithOptions&quot;,\n  options: {\n    settings: settings,\n  },\n};\n \nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\n \nconst path = &quot;wallet/add-funds&quot;;\nwallet.openWallet(path, intent);\n:::tip Check out some example Dapp source code\nFor a complete examples, see Demo-Dapp and Demo-Dapp-Web3Modal.\n:::\n:::caution Avoid Browsers Blocking Sequence Popup\nMost browsers will block popups if they are called outside of user-triggered event handlers like onclick, or when it takes too long to process between the user action and the actual window\nRead more about browser popup-blocking here.\n:::\n\n\n","title":"Connecting your dapp with 0xsequence","titles":["Connect Wallet"]},"297":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/guides/connect-wallet#wallet-login-and-connect-options","html":"\n<p>Dapps with direct sequence integration can specify a <code>ConnectOptions</code> object when running <code>wallet.connect()</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>const connectDetails = await wallet.connect(connectOptions)</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>The option parameters are described below.</p>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nDapps with direct sequence integration can specify a ConnectOptions object when running wallet.connect().\nconst connectDetails = await wallet.connect(connectOptions)\nThe option parameters are described below.\n","title":"Wallet Login and Connect Options","titles":["Connect Wallet"]},"298":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/guides/connect-wallet#app","html":"\n<p>App name of the dapp which will be announced to user on connect screen.</p>\n<p>Example: <code>await wallet.connect({ app: &#x27;My defi app&#x27; })</code></p>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nApp name of the dapp which will be announced to user on connect screen.\nExample: await wallet.connect({ app: &#x27;My defi app&#x27; })\n","title":"app","titles":["Connect Wallet","Wallet Login and Connect Options",null]},"299":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/guides/connect-wallet#appprotocol","html":"\n<p>Custom protocol for auth redirect (unity/unreal).</p>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nCustom protocol for auth redirect (unity/unreal).\n","title":"appProtocol","titles":["Connect Wallet","Wallet Login and Connect Options",null]},"300":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/guides/connect-wallet#origin","html":"\n<p>Origin hint of the dapp&#x27;s host opening the wallet.
