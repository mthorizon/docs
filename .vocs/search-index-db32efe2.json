and deploy asset metadata to such as an image to that token.\n\n\nCall CreateCollection endpoint - ensure you pass in the Secret Service Token created in the prior section.\n\n\nCreateToken - use returned collectionId from previous request\n\n\nCreateAsset - use collectionId and your tokenId\n\nset metadataField (assetType) to one of the following\n\nimage\nanimation_url\naudio\nvideo\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload file with PUT method to this endpoint PUT {metadata-server}/projects/{projectId}/collections/{collectionId}/tokens/{tokenId}/upload/{assetIdOrAssetType}- use assetId that is returned in step 3 OR, you can pass assetType, such as &quot;image&quot;\n\n\n\nFor example you can upload to https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1/tokens/1/upload/image which will find the asset of the type &quot;image&quot; for the token, and will upload there.\n\nYou can also pass in the assetId if you prefer, i.e., PUT https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1/assets/1/upload\n\n\nAsset types include: image, audio, video, animation_url\n\n\n\nAsset is now privately accessible with JWT token at GET {metadata-server}/projects/{projectID}/collections/{collectionID}/tokens/{tokenID}/asset/{assetType}\n\nfor example: https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1/tokens/1/asset/image\n\n\n\nPublishCollection -- this sets the collection to be accessible by the public\n\n\nGetCollection -- will return both baseURIs for contract and token level metadata.\n\n\n\nCollection-level metadata (aka contract-level) metadata: https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1 or https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1.json\nToken-level metadata: https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1/tokens/{tokenId}\n\nie. https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1/tokens/1 or https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1/tokens/1.json\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to use the metadata in your contract,

For example, on Ethereum mainnet the Sequence Relayer endpoint is\nhttps://mainnet-relayer.sequence.app and Polygon is https://polygon-relayer.sequence.app.🌄 View the full list of supported networks and Relayer endpoints here\n","title":"Installation","titles":[]},"59":{"href":"/api/transactions/installation#web--nodejs-installation","html":"\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">npm</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> install</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> 0xsequence</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> ethers</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">pnpm</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> install</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> 0xsequence</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> ethers</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">yarn</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> add</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> 0xsequence</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> ethers</span></span></code></pre>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nnpm install 0xsequence ethers\nor\npnpm install 0xsequence ethers\nor\nyarn add 0xsequence ethers\n","title":"Web / node.js Installation","titles":["Installation",null]},"60":{"href":"/api/transactions/installation#go-installation","html":"\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\" data-title=\"Terminal\" data-lang=\"bash\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">go</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> get</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\"> -u</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence@latest</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>then in your app,</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\" data-title=\"Go\" data-lang=\"go\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">import</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> (</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">\t&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence/relayer</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">&quot;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">)</span></span></code></pre>","isPage":false,"text":"\ngo get -u github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence@latest\nthen in your app,\nimport (\n\t&quot;github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence/relayer&quot;\n)","title":"Go Installation","titles":["Installation",null]},"61":{"href":"/api/transactions/overview#transactions-api","html":"</header>\n<aside data-callout=\"note\"><p><a href=\"https://0xsequence.redoc.ly/tag/relayer\">Transactions API documentation and endpoints</a></p></aside>\n<p>The Sequence Transactions API (or the technical term Relayer service) offers a simple interface for dispatching meta-transactions on Ethereum-compatible networks.</p>\n<p>Meta-transactions are the idea of a transaction inside of a transaction.

This process occurs automatically when a user logs in for the first time after the migration has been implemented where the process looks like the following:\n\n\nUser Authentication\n\nWhen a user attempts to log in, user authenticates with their desired social provider or email using the Sequence Embedded Wallets SDK.\nOnce the user is authenticated, the authenticated user data such as email address, username, or other unique user identifier along with the sequence wallet address is passed to your backend.\n\n\n\nDatabase Lookup and Update\n\nUpdate your user database with a &#x27;sequenceWallet&#x27; column.\nThe database is queried with the unique user identifier to retrieve the corresponding user&#x27;s record.\nThe system checks if a &#x27;sequenceWallet&#x27; already exists for this user. If so, no actoin is taken.\nIf no Sequence wallet address is found:\na. The passed sequence wallet is inserted in the &#x27;sequenceWallet&#x27; column.\nIf a user doesn&#x27;t exist in the database, insert the passed information as a net-new user.\n\n\n\nAsset Migration\n\nAfter the user is successfully logged in, the system checks if asset migration has already occurred.\nIf not, a prompt is displayed to the user, explaining the need to migrate their assets from their old wallet to the new Sequence Embedded Wallet.\nThe user logs in to the previous provider as a one-time event, and migrates the desired assets to their new sequence wallet.\nWe suggest using Sequence&#x27;s Indexer to query the relevant assets to display these along with amounts to the user for ease of migration.\n\n\n\nPlease get in touch with any questions if your migration is more complex and we are happy to help.","title":"Just-In-Time Migration Process","titles":["Migration Guide: Moving to Sequence Embedded Wallets"]},"470":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/link-wallets/overview#wallet-linking-overview","html":"</header>\n<p>Wallet Linking enables the ability for a developer to create a verifiable association between two wallets from a single user.
