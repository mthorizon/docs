to connect their wallet using one of multiple possible protocols.\n\nThe user selects the WalletConnect option.\n\nA QR code is displayed, which can be scanned by Sequence.\nAlternatively, the user can also choose to copy the connection details via their OS clipboard.\n\nBack in the Sequence interface, the user chooses &quot;Scan&quot;.\n\nThe QR code from the dapp is scanned.\nAlternatively, the code is pasted from the OS clipboard if the user chose that previously.\n\nThe user confirms the connection request.\n\nThe connection succeeded, and the dapp is updated to reflect that.\n\nWhile connected, the dapp is able to make signing requests to Sequence.\nSequence will always prompt for confirmation from the user for any activity initiated by the dapp.\n\nOnce the user has finished

To see a complete application, see the demo-waas-auth repository. A functional demo is also available here.\nBegin with a simple main.tsx file that sets up the WaaS SDK, the router, and the Google OAuth provider.\nimport { SequenceWaaS } from &#x27;@0xsequence/waas&#x27;\nimport { GoogleOAuthProvider } from &#x27;@react-oauth/google&#x27;\nimport { createHashRouter, RouterProvider } from &#x27;react-router-dom&#x27;\n \nconst waas = new SequenceWaaS({\n  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,\n  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,\n  network: &#x27;arbitrum-nova&#x27;\n})\n \nexport const router = createHashRouter([\n  {\n    path: &#x27;/login&#x27;,\n    element: &lt;Login /&gt;\n  },\n  {\n    path: &#x27;/&#x27;,\n    element: &lt;App /&gt;\n  }\n])\n \nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(&#x27;root&#x27;)!).render(\n  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;\n      &lt;GoogleOAuthProvider clientId={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}&gt;\n        &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n      &lt;/GoogleOAuthProvider&gt;\n  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;\n)\nThe useSessionHash hook is used to obtain a session hash that is used to prevent replay attacks. The sequence.getSessionHash function is used to obtain the session hash, and the sequence.onSessionStateChanged function is used to update the session hash when the session state changes.\nimport { sequence } from &#x27;./main&#x27;\nimport { useEffect, useState } from &quot;react&quot;;\n \nexport function useSessionHash() {\n    const [sessionHash, setSessionHash] = useState(&quot;&quot;)\n    const [error, setError] = useState&lt;any&gt;(undefined)\n \n    useEffect(() =&gt; {\n        const handler = async () =&gt; {\n            try {\n                setSessionHash(await sequence.getSessionHash())\n            } catch (error) {\n                console.error(error)\n                setError(error)\n            }\n        }\n        handler()\n        return sequence.onSessionStateChanged(handler)\n    }, [setSessionHash, setError])\n \n    return {\n        sessionHash,\n        error,\n        loading: !!sessionHash,\n    }\n}\nTo handle the Google login, you can use the GoogleLogin component from the @react-oauth/google package. The handleGoogleLogin function is called when the user successfully logs in.\nimport { router, sequence } from &#x27;./main&#x27;\nimport { CredentialResponse, GoogleLogin } from &#x27;@react-oauth/google&#x27;\nimport { useSessionHash } from &quot;./useSessionHash.ts&quot;;\n \nfunction Login() {\n  const { sessionHash } = useSessionHash()\n  const [signingIn, setSigningIn] = useState(false)\n \n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    (async () =&gt; {\n      if (await sequence.isSignedIn()) {\n        router.navigate(&#x27;/&#x27;)\n      }\n    })()\n  }, [])\n \n  const handleGoogleLogin = async (tokenResponse: CredentialResponse) =&gt; {\n    const walletAddress = await sequence.signIn({\n      idToken: tokenResponse.credential!\n    }, &quot;MacBook Pro - Chrome&quot;)\n \n    console.log(`Wallet address: ${walletAddress}`)\n    router.navigate(&#x27;/&#x27;)\n  }\n \n  return (\n    {!!sessionHash &amp;&amp; (&lt;&gt;\n      &lt;GoogleLogin onSuccess={handleGoogleLogin} shape=&quot;circle&quot; width={230} nonce={sessionHash} /&gt;\n    &lt;/&gt;)}\n )\n}\n \nexport default Login\n","title":"Google / Apple Auth","titles":["Session Management","Sign in / Sign Up"]},"472":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/03-manage-sessions#list-sessions","html":"\n<p>This function returns a list of sessions for the current user and only includes sessions that are still valid.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">import</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> { SequenceWaaS } </span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">from</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> &#x27;@0xsequence/waas&#x27;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\" data-empty-line=\"true\"> </span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">const</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\"> waas</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> new</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\"> SequenceWaaS</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">({</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  projectAccessKey: </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">`${</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">process</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">env</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">}`</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  waasConfigKey: </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">`${</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">process</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">env</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">WAAS_CONFIG_KEY</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">}`</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  network: </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">&#x27;arbitrum-nova&#x27;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">})</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\" data-empty-line=\"true\"> </span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">await</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> waas.</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\">signIn</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">({ idToken }, </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">&quot;MacBook Pro -
