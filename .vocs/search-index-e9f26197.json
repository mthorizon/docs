The Typescript SDK makes integration straightforward.\n\nAs for the benefits, both wallets offer non-custodial smart contract wallets with advantages like gasless transactions. If you prioritize a smooth, web2/2.5-like experience, the Embedded Wallet is the way to go. For a focus on web2.5/web3 native users, the Universal Wallet is recommended.\nFurthermore, our Sequence Kit wallet connector merges both options into a customizable UI written in Typescript. This allows you to cater to users with existing wallets like Metamask, as well as millions of potential new users who prefer the convenience of social login.\n","title":"Sequence Wallets Overview","titles":[]},"170":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/overview#getting-started","html":"\n<p>Please check out <a href=\"https://sequence.build\">Sequence Builder</a> to create a project and select Wallets to get started.

integrating 0xsequence, users may access your dapp without having to install any special extensions,\nand the wallet also works on mobile browsers!\n:::\nYour dapp can connect to your user&#x27;s wallet by first instantiating the Wallet provider:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\n \nconst projectAccessKey = &#x27;&lt;access_key&gt;&#x27;\n \n// This assumes your dapp runs on Ethereum mainnet\nconst wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey);\n \n// If your dapp runs on a different EVM-compatible blockchain, you can specify its name\n// const wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey, { defaultNetwork: &#x27;polygon&#x27; });\nNote that is possible to retrieve the above instance by using the getWallet() method:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\nOnce you have the instance, you can connect to the wallet:\nconst connectDetails = await wallet.connect({\n  app: &quot;Your Dapp name&quot;,\n  authorize: true,\n  // And pass settings if you would like to customize further\n  settings: {\n    theme: &quot;light&quot;,\n    bannerUrl:

Unlike any other solution on the market, WaaS also allows developers to leverage their own OIDC identifiers with these services.

The idToken is obtained from the social auth provider and used to open a session. You can see a sample React application using Google auth below. To see a complete application, see the demo-waas-auth repository. A functional demo is also available here.\nBegin with a simple main.tsx file that sets up the WaaS SDK, the router, and the Google OAuth provider.\nimport { SequenceWaaS } from &#x27;@0xsequence/waas&#x27;\nimport { GoogleOAuthProvider } from &#x27;@react-oauth/google&#x27;\nimport { createHashRouter, RouterProvider } from &#x27;react-router-dom&#x27;\n \nconst waas = new SequenceWaaS({\n  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,\n  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,\n  network: &#x27;arbitrum-nova&#x27;\n})\n \nexport const router = createHashRouter([\n  {\n    path: &#x27;/login&#x27;,\n    element: &lt;Login /&gt;\n  },\n  {\n    path: &#x27;/&#x27;,\n    element: &lt;App /&gt;\n  }\n])\n \nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(&#x27;root&#x27;)!).render(\n  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;\n      &lt;GoogleOAuthProvider clientId={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}&gt;\n        &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n      &lt;/GoogleOAuthProvider&gt;\n  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;\n)\nThe useSessionHash hook is used to obtain a session hash that is used to prevent replay attacks. The sequence.getSessionHash function is used to obtain the session hash, and the sequence.onSessionStateChanged function is used to update the session hash when the session state changes.\nimport { sequence } from &#x27;./main&#x27;\nimport { useEffect, useState } from &quot;react&quot;;\n \nexport function useSessionHash() {\n    const [sessionHash, setSessionHash] = useState(&quot;&quot;)\n    const [error, setError] = useState&lt;any&gt;(undefined)\n \n    useEffect(() =&gt; {\n        const handler = async () =&gt; {\n            try {\n                setSessionHash(await sequence.getSessionHash())\n            } catch (error) {\n                console.error(error)\n                setError(error)\n            }\n        }\n        handler()\n        return sequence.onSessionStateChanged(handler)\n    }, [setSessionHash, setError])\n \n    return {\n        sessionHash,\n        error,\n        loading: !!sessionHash,\n    }\n}\nTo handle the Google login, you can use the GoogleLogin component from the @react-oauth/google package. The handleGoogleLogin function is called when the user successfully logs in.\nMake sure to re-render the component whenever sessionHash changes to avoid hard-to-track discrepancy errors. For example, you can use the key attribute to force the re-render.\nimport { router, sequence } from &#x27;./main&#x27;\nimport { CredentialResponse, GoogleLogin } from

But it&#x27;s not foolproof. You might notice that such a simple comparison of two values is not real proof. After all, the enclave might have been tampered with and what we see is make believe. Indeed, the PCR0 values for each release are publicly available.\nThis is where cryptographic attestation comes in. While we haven&#x27;t yet published tools that would do the validation, it can be performed using this great guide by AWS.\nEvery enclave request returns the attestation document in a Base64-encoded format in the X-Attestation-Document response header. A request might optionally include a X-Attestation-Nonce header containing a value that will be signed and included in the attestation document as well.\nFor example, you can get the attestation document by running:\ncurl -si https://waas.sequence.app/health -H X-Attestation-Nonce:0123456789abcdef | grep x-attestation-document","title":"The hard way","titles":["Enclave verification"]},"454":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/implementation-details/intents#intents","html":"</header>\n<p>All user interactions with their account, sessions and wallet are performed through actions called &quot;intents.&quot; This page provides details on how they work internally.
