The advantages are:\n\nAuthenticate users with common social providers or email.\nSupport for Unity, Unreal, Web, and Mobile.\nOptional pop-ups, modals, and transaction signing for a seamless UX.\nFully non-custodial, smart contract wallet.\nOut of the box login with Sequence Kit or build your own flow.\n\nOn the other hand, the Universal Wallet caters primarily to native web3 gaming users on Web.\n\nOur Sequence Kit library merges both options into a customizable UI written in Typescript, tailored for a browser experience. This is great when you want to support users with existing wallets like Metamask, have an out-of-the-box experience, as well as millions of potential new users who prefer the convenience of social login.\nLastly, we provide Wallet Linking for your ecosystem which enables the ability for a developer to create a verifiable association between two wallets from a single user.

will return at most one token instance from each contract.\nIn order to fetch ERC721/1155 token balances, you must pass the contractAddress to the GetTokenBalances method.\nThis will return all of the tokens owned by accountAddress from the specified contractAddress.\nSee section below for more information.\n","title":"Fetches list of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens and metadata in any

You may query any contract address on any of the supported networks (but make\nsure to query the indexer of the corresponding network).\nSequence Indexer GetTokenSupplies Method:\n\nRequest: POST /rpc/Indexer/GetTokenSupplies\nContent-Type: application/json\nBody (in JSON):\n\ncontractAddress (string) -- a ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC1155 contract address\nincludeMetadata (boolean - optional - default: false) -- toggle token metadata to be included in the response\nmetadataOptions (object - optional) -- additional options for metadata\n\nverifiedOnly (boolean - optional) -- return only contracts which are &#x27;verified&#x27; to help reduce spam\nincludeContracts ([]string - optional) -- list of specific contract addresses to always be included, even if verifiedOnly is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: GetTokenSupplies of Skyweaver contract on Polygon using an AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY\ncurl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Access-Key: AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY&quot; https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app/rpc/Indexer/GetTokenSupplies -d &#x27;{ &quot;contractAddress&quot;: &quot;0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E&quot;, &quot;includeMetadata&quot;: true }&#x27;// Works in both a Webapp (browser) or Node.js:\nimport { SequenceIndexer } from &#x27;@0xsequence/indexer&#x27;\n \nconst indexer = new SequenceIndexer(&#x27;https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app&#x27;, &#x27;AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY&#x27;)\n \n// here we query the Skyweaver contract address, but you can use any\nconst contractAddress = &#x27;0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E&#x27;\n \n// query Sequence Indexer for all token details / supplies\nconst tokenDetails = await indexer.getTokenSupplies({\n\tcontractAddress: contractAddress,\n\tincludeMetadata: true\n})\nconsole.log(&#x27;token details of contract:&#x27;, tokenDetails)go\nimport (\n\t&quot;context&quot;\n\t&quot;fmt&quot;\n\t&quot;log&quot;\n\t&quot;net/http&quot;\n \n\t&quot;github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence/indexer&quot;\n)\n \nfunc GetTokenSupplies(contractAddress string) {\n\tseqIndexer := indexer.NewIndexer(&quot;https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app&quot;, &quot;AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY&quot;)\n \n\tmetadataOptions := indexer.MetadataOptions{\n\t\tVerifiedOnly:     true, // Set to true if you want to fetch only verified contracts\n\t\tUnverifiedOnly:   false,\n\t\tIncludeContracts: nil, // Provide a list of specific contracts to include, if any\n\t}\n \n\t_, _, tokenDetails, err := seqIndexer.GetTokenSupplies(context.Background(), contractAddress, nil, &amp;metadataOptions, nil)\n\t\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n \n\tfmt.Println(&quot;token details:&quot;, tokenDetails)\n}","title":"Fetch all unique tokens in a particular ERC20/721/1155 contract, including total supplies","titles":["Tokens in a contract",null]},"241":{"href":"/api/marketplace/examples/get-user-activities#getuseractivities","html":"\n<p>Enables you to retrieve activity data for a specific user, including orders and trades.

assumes your dapp runs on Ethereum mainnet\nconst wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey);\n \n// If your dapp runs on a different EVM-compatible blockchain, you can specify its name\n// const wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey, { defaultNetwork: &#x27;polygon&#x27; });\nNote that is possible to retrieve the above instance by using the getWallet() method:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\nOnce you have the instance, you can connect to the wallet:\nconst connectDetails = await wallet.connect({\n  app: &quot;Your Dapp name&quot;,\n  authorize: true,\n  // And pass settings if you would like to customize further\n  settings: {\n    theme: &quot;light&quot;,\n    bannerUrl: &quot;https://yoursite.com/banner-image.png&quot;, // 3:1 aspect ratio, 1200x400 works best\n    includedPaymentProviders: [&quot;moonpay&quot;, &quot;ramp&quot;],\n    defaultFundingCurrency: &quot;matic&quot;,\n    lockFundingCurrencyToDefault: false,\n  },\n});\n \nconsole.log(&quot;user accepted connect?&quot;, connectDetails.connected);\nconsole.log(\n  &quot;users signed connect proof to valid their account address:&quot;,\n  connectDetails.proof\n);\nYou can pick/limit the available sign in options with signInOptions. Will be ignored if user is already signed in.\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\n \nawait wallet.connect({\n  app: &quot;Your Dapp name&quot;,\n  settings: { signInOptions: [&quot;google&quot;] },\n});\nAfter you connect, you can use wallet.openWallet() to open the wallet:\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\nwallet.openWallet();\nYou can also optionally pass a path, and use openWithOptions intent to pass settings when you open the wallet:\nconst settings: Settings = {\n  theme: &quot;dark&quot;,\n  bannerUrl: &quot;https://yoursite.com/banner-image.png&quot;, // 3:1 aspect ratio, 1200x400 works best\n  includedPaymentProviders: [&quot;moonpay&quot;, &quot;ramp&quot;],\n  defaultFundingCurrency: &quot;eth&quot;,\n  lockFundingCurrencyToDefault: false,\n};\n \nconst intent: OpenWalletIntent = {\n  type: &quot;openWithOptions&quot;,\n  options: {\n    settings: settings,\n  },\n};\n \nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\n \nconst path = &quot;wallet/add-funds&quot;;\nwallet.openWallet(path, intent);\nCheck out some example Dapp source codeFor a complete examples, see Demo-Dapp and Demo-Dapp-Web3Modal.\nAvoid Browsers Blocking Sequence PopupMost browsers will block popups if they are called outside of user-triggered event handlers like onclick, or when it takes too long to process between the user action and the actual windowRead more about browser popup-blocking here.\n\n\n","title":"Connecting your dapp with 0xsequence","titles":["Connect Wallet"]},"275":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/guides/connect-wallet#wallet-login-and-connect-options","html":"\n<p>Dapps with direct sequence integration can specify a <code>ConnectOptions</code> object when running <code>wallet.connect()</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>const connectDetails = await wallet.connect(connectOptions)</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>The option parameters are described below.</p>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nDapps with direct sequence integration can specify a ConnectOptions object when running wallet.connect().\nconst connectDetails = await wallet.connect(connectOptions)\nThe option parameters are described below.\n","title":"Wallet Login and Connect Options","titles":["Connect Wallet"]},"276":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/guides/connect-wallet#app","html":"\n<p>App name of the dapp which will be announced to user on connect screen.</p>\n<p>Example: <code>await wallet.connect({ app: &#x27;My defi app&#x27; })</code></p>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nApp name of the dapp which will be announced to user on connect screen.\nExample: await wallet.connect({ app: &#x27;My defi app&#x27; })\n","title":"app","titles":["Connect Wallet","Wallet Login and Connect Options",null]},"277":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/guides/connect-wallet#appprotocol","html":"\n<p>Custom protocol for auth redirect (unity/unreal).</p>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nCustom protocol for auth redirect (unity/unreal).\n","title":"appProtocol","titles":["Connect Wallet","Wallet Login and Connect Options",null]},"278":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/guides/connect-wallet#origin","html":"\n<p>Origin hint of the dapp&#x27;s host opening the wallet.
