In this demo these are imported and set at the top in App.tsx.import { install } from &quot;react-native-quick-crypto&quot;;\ninstall();\n \nimport &quot;@ethersproject/shims&quot;;\n \nimport &quot;react-native-url-polyfill/auto&quot;;\nimport { ReadableStream } from &quot;web-streams-polyfill&quot;;\nglobalThis.ReadableStream = ReadableStream;Secondly, we need to set aliases for the shims, in babel.config.js with help of the dev dependency babel-plugin-module-resolver, and also we need to make sure to use pbkdf2 from react-native-quick-crypto. This helps us speed up the random value generation. See babel.config.js for the code snippet to update the aliases.(See https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/2250#issuecomment-1321134111 for more details on react-native-quick-crypto alias setup)","title":"Setup shims for ethers and other crypto related packages","titles":["Mobile SDK for Embedded Wallet (React Native)","Integration details"]},"21":{"href":"/sdk/mobile#initialize-sequence-waas","html":"<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">export</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> const</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\"> sequenceWaas</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> new</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\"> SequenceWaaS</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">(</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    network: initialNetwork,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    projectAccessKey: projectAccessKey,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    waasConfigKey: waasConfigKey,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  },</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  localStorage,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">  null</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">  new</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\"> KeychainSecureStoreBackend</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">()</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">);</span></span></code></pre><p>(Check <a href=\"https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-waas-react-native/blob/main/waasSetup.ts\">waasSetup.ts</a> file for more details)</p></div><div data-depth=\"3\">","isPage":false,"text":"export const sequenceWaas = new SequenceWaaS(\n  {\n    network: initialNetwork,\n    projectAccessKey: projectAccessKey,\n    waasConfigKey: waasConfigKey,\n  },\n  localStorage,\n  null,\n  new KeychainSecureStoreBackend()\n);(Check waasSetup.ts file for more details)","title":"Initialize Sequence WaaS","titles":["Mobile SDK for Embedded Wallet (React Native)","Integration details"]},"22":{"href":"/sdk/mobile#signing-in","html":"<p>Once you have an initialized Sequence WaaS instance, you can use it to sign in with email, Google or Apple.
