integrating 0xsequence, users may access your dapp without having to install any special extensions,\nand the wallet also works on mobile browsers!\n:::\nYour dapp can connect to your user&#x27;s wallet by first instantiating the Wallet provider:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\n \nconst projectAccessKey = &#x27;&lt;access_key&gt;&#x27;\n \n// This assumes your dapp runs on Ethereum mainnet\nconst wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey);\n \n// If your dapp runs on a different EVM-compatible blockchain, you can specify its name\n// const wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey, { defaultNetwork: &#x27;polygon&#x27; });\nNote that is possible to retrieve the above instance by using the getWallet() method:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\nOnce you have the instance, you can connect to the wallet:\nconst connectDetails = await wallet.connect({\n  app: &quot;Your Dapp name&quot;,\n  authorize: true,\n  // And pass settings if you would like to customize further\n  settings: {\n    theme: &quot;light&quot;,\n    bannerUrl:

They provide a convenient and secure way for users to authorize specific actions in a decentralized application without requiring them to confirm each action through their primary wallet.\nBy signing a message with their primary wallet (e.g., Sequence Wallet), users can authorize a session key to act on their behalf for a limited time or scope. Applications can then interpret signed messages from the session key as if they were coming directly from the user&#x27;s wallet, streamlining the user experience.\nSession keys are particularly useful for applications that require frequent user interactions, as they help reduce the number of wallet confirmations needed, while still maintaining a secure and verifiable authentication process.\n","title":"Session Keys","titles":[]},"248":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/03-guides/04-session-keys#using-session-keys-with-sequence","html":"</header>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\n","title":"Using Session keys with Sequence","titles":[]},"249":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/03-guides/04-session-keys#1-initialize-sequence-wallet-and-connect","html":"\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">import</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> { Wallet } </span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">from</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> &#x27;@0xsequence/wallet&#x27;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">import</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> { ethers } </span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">from</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> &#x27;ethers&#x27;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\" data-empty-line=\"true\"> </span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">const</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\"> wallet</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> new</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\"> Wallet</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">()</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">await</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> wallet.</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\">connect</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">()</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\" data-empty-line=\"true\"> </span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">const</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\"> signer</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> wallet.</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\">getSigner</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">()</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">const</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\"> userAddress</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> signer.</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\">getAddress</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">()</span></span></code></pre>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nimport { Wallet } from &#x27;@0xsequence/wallet&#x27;\nimport { ethers } from &#x27;ethers&#x27;\n \nconst wallet = new Wallet()\nawait wallet.connect()\n \nconst signer = wallet.getSigner()\nconst userAddress = signer.getAddress()\n","title":"1.

The idToken is obtained from the social auth provider and used to open a session. You can see a sample React application using Google auth below. To see a complete application, see the demo-waas-auth repository. A functional demo is also available here.\nBegin with a simple main.tsx file that sets up the WaaS SDK, the router, and the Google OAuth provider.\nimport { SequenceWaaS } from &#x27;@0xsequence/waas&#x27;\nimport { GoogleOAuthProvider } from &#x27;@react-oauth/google&#x27;\nimport { createHashRouter, RouterProvider } from &#x27;react-router-dom&#x27;\n \nconst waas = new SequenceWaaS({\n  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,\n  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,\n  network: &#x27;mumbai&#x27;\n}, defaults.TEST)\n \nexport const router = createHashRouter([\n  {\n    path: &#x27;/login&#x27;,\n    element: &lt;Login /&gt;\n  },\n  {\n    path: &#x27;/&#x27;,\n    element: &lt;App /&gt;\n  }\n])\n \nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(&#x27;root&#x27;)!).render(\n  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;\n      &lt;GoogleOAuthProvider clientId={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}&gt;\n        &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n      &lt;/GoogleOAuthProvider&gt;\n  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;\n)\nThe useSessionHash hook is used to obtain a session hash that is used to prevent replay attacks. The sequence.getSessionHash function is used to obtain the session hash, and the sequence.onSessionStateChanged function is used to update the session hash when the session state changes.\nimport { sequence } from &#x27;./main&#x27;\nimport { useEffect, useState } from &quot;react&quot;;\n \nexport function useSessionHash() {\n    const [sessionHash, setSessionHash] = useState(&quot;&quot;)\n    const [error, setError] = useState&lt;any&gt;(undefined)\n \n    useEffect(() =&gt; {\n        const handler = async () =&gt; {\n            try {\n                setSessionHash(await sequence.getSessionHash())\n            } catch (error) {\n                console.error(error)\n                setError(error)\n            }\n        }\n        handler()\n        return sequence.onSessionStateChanged(handler)\n    }, [setSessionHash, setError])\n \n    return {\n        sessionHash,\n        error,\n        loading: !!sessionHash,\n    }\n}\nTo handle the Google login, you can use the GoogleLogin component from the @react-oauth/google package.
