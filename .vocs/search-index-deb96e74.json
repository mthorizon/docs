In this demo these are imported and set at the top in App.tsx.import { install } from &quot;react-native-quick-crypto&quot;;\ninstall();\n \nimport &quot;@ethersproject/shims&quot;;\n \nimport &quot;react-native-url-polyfill/auto&quot;;\nimport { ReadableStream } from &quot;web-streams-polyfill&quot;;\nglobalThis.ReadableStream = ReadableStream;Secondly, we need to set aliases for the shims, in babel.config.js with help of the dev dependency babel-plugin-module-resolver, and also we need to make sure to use pbkdf2 from react-native-quick-crypto. This helps us speed up the random value generation. See babel.config.js for the code snippet to update the aliases.(See https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/2250#issuecomment-1321134111 for more details on react-native-quick-crypto alias setup)","title":"Setup shims for ethers and other crypto related packages","titles":["Mobile SDK for Embedded Wallet (React Native)","Integration details"]},"21":{"href":"/sdk/mobile#initialize-sequence-waas","html":"<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">export</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> const</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\"> sequenceWaas</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> new</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\"> SequenceWaaS</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">(</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    network: initialNetwork,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    projectAccessKey: projectAccessKey,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    waasConfigKey: waasConfigKey,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  },</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  localStorage,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">  null</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">  new</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\"> KeychainSecureStoreBackend</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">()</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">);</span></span></code></pre><p>(Check <a href=\"https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-waas-react-native/blob/main/waasSetup.ts\">waasSetup.ts</a> file for more details)</p></div><div data-depth=\"3\">","isPage":false,"text":"export const sequenceWaas = new SequenceWaaS(\n  {\n    network: initialNetwork,\n    projectAccessKey: projectAccessKey,\n    waasConfigKey: waasConfigKey,\n  },\n  localStorage,\n  null,\n  new KeychainSecureStoreBackend()\n);(Check waasSetup.ts file for more details)","title":"Initialize Sequence WaaS","titles":["Mobile SDK for Embedded Wallet (React Native)","Integration details"]},"22":{"href":"/sdk/mobile#signing-in","html":"<p>Once you have an initialized Sequence WaaS instance, you can use it to sign in with email, Google or Apple.

The &quot;use client&quot; directive is what will turn the wrapper component into a Client Component to be rendered in the browser.\nIn addition, there is a bug with wagmi and nextJs when using the autoConnect feature which causes\nIn the example below, we declare a wrapper component with the &quot;use client&quot; directive:\n&quot;use client&quot; // this directive informs next.js that the component is a Client Component to be rendered in the browser\n \nconst WagmiWrapper = ({ children }) =&gt; {\n  const wagmiClient = createClient({\n    autoConnect: true,\n    connectors,\n    provider,\n    webSocketProvider,\n  });\n \n \n  return (\n    &lt;WagmiConfig client={wagmiClient}&gt;\n      {children}\n    &lt;/WagmiConfig&gt;\n  );\n}\n \nexport default WagmiWrapper\nThis wrapper component can then be imported normally and wrap the rest of the application. The child components can be a combination of Client and Server components.\n// We import a custom wrapper component that initializes the wallet library and all its connectors\n// An example of the content of this wrapper component can be found here: https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-dapp-wagmi-next/blob/master/components/WagmiProvider.tsx\nimport WagmiWrapper from &#x27;./WagmiWrapper&#x27;\n \n// We can then wrap our entire app with this browser&#x27;s rendered component\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return (\n    &lt;WagmiWrapper&gt;\n      &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;\n    &lt;/WagmiWrapper&gt;\n  );\n}\nA full code example using Nextjs and the app directory can be found on github.\nThe method described above is the one recommended by Wagmi through their NextJs example which can be consulted by running the command npx create-wagmi and selecting the nextJs option.\nClick here for more information about Client Components.","title":"How do I use a wallet library and connector with next.js using the app directory (version 13 and above only)?","titles":[null,"NextJs"]},"260":{"href":"/sdk/typescript/connectors/overview#wallet-connectors","html":"</header>\n<p>Sequence is compatible with all standard Ethereum libraries and connectors.
