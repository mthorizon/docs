By calling the Indexer RPC methods with\n&quot;metadataOptions&quot;: { &quot;verifiedOnly&quot;: true }, any contract address which has not been verified, will\nbe omitted from the results. We recommend using this option all the time, but, the downside is\nif your project&#x27;s contracts are unverified, then they will also be omitted from the results.

Binary data is further subtyped into FUnsizedData, which represents data of any variable size, and TSizedData&lt;TSize&gt;, which represents data of a required byte length TSize.\nImportant cryptographic types of set size, such as 32-byte private keys, are defined as subtypes of TSizedData- for example, we define FPrivateKey : TSizedData&lt;32&gt;. These can also be loaded from hex strings using From(FString Str), such as FPrivateKey::From(&quot;0x0...0&quot;);.

This solves a number of issues for games such as:\n\nValidating a user holds an NFT, but doesn&#x27;t want to move their valuable asset around for token-gating or reward distributions.\nEasy migration for flow of funds or liquidity from an external wallet to the embedded wallet for a game.\nVerifiying a number of ERC20 tokens a user holds to provide governance rights.\n\nUsing Sequence SDKs, the embedded wallet session can be instantiated from nearly any platform such as Mobile, Web, PC or Console so users can enjoy a seamless game experience. However, when desired, a verifiable URL is generated for the user to direct them to a browser session to link their external wallets.\n","title":"Wallet Linking Overview","titles":[]},"414":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/link-wallets/overview#try-a-demo","html":"\n<aside data-callout=\"info\"><p>Try out how wallet linking works <a href=\"https://0xsequence.github.io/demo-waas-auth/\">here</a> by authenticating with your social login and selecting EOA Link</p></aside>\n<p>Dive into the implementation for your own game or application, by following our <a href=\"/solutions/wallets/link-wallets/integration-guide\">integration guide</a>.</p>","isPage":false,"text":"\nTry out how wallet linking works here by authenticating with your social login and selecting EOA Link\nDive into the implementation for your own game or application, by following our integration guide.","title":"Try a Demo","titles":["Wallet Linking Overview"]},"415":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/checkout#checkout-overview","html":"</header>\n<p>The checkout modal enables developers to easily facilitate cryptocurrency payments.</p>\n<div class=\"text--center\"><img src=\"/img/kit/checkout-modal.png\" alt=\"make it easier for users to checkout with a collectible in your dap with the Kit checkout modal\"/></div>\n<header>","isPage":true,"text":"\nThe checkout modal enables developers to easily facilitate cryptocurrency payments.\n\n","title":"Checkout Overview","titles":[]},"416":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/checkout#integration","html":"</header>\n<p>To integrate the checkout feature, follow these steps:</p>\n<div data-vocs-steps=\"true\"><div data-depth=\"2\">","isPage":false,"text":"\nTo integrate the checkout feature, follow these steps:\n","title":"Integration","titles":[]},"417":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/checkout#1-install-the-kit-checkout-module","html":"<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">npm</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> install</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> @0xsequence/kit-checkout</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D;--shiki-dark:#768390\"># or</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">pnpm</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> install</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> @0xsequence/kit-checkout</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D;--shiki-dark:#768390\"># or</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">yarn</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> add</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> @0xsequence/kit-checkout</span></span></code></pre></div><div data-depth=\"2\">","isPage":false,"text":"npm install @0xsequence/kit-checkout\n# or\npnpm install @0xsequence/kit-checkout\n# or\nyarn add @0xsequence/kit-checkout","title":"1.
