By calling the Indexer RPC methods with\n&quot;metadataOptions&quot;: { &quot;verifiedOnly&quot;: true }, any contract address which has not been verified, will\nbe omitted from the results. We recommend using this option all the time, but, the downside is\nif your project&#x27;s contracts are unverified, then they will also be omitted from the results.

Note that the user will need to have the required funds in their wallet in order to pay the value specified to a payable function.\nContractABIAsString: This can either be the entire ABI or just the function you plan on interacting with. If you&#x27;re not familiar with ABIs, we&#x27;d recommend copy-pasting the function signature (with parameters) from the contract source code on Etherscan (or the appropriate block explorer for your network) and removing the whitespace and variable names.\nParametersAsObjectArray: The parameters you want to provide to the method you wish to call. No need to provide the parameter names, just their values in the order they appear in the ABI. Provide parameters in string format when in doubt.\nFunctionNameAsString: The name of the function you want to call as it appears in the ABI (or source code).

This solves a number of issues for games such as:\n\nValidating a user holds an NFT, but doesn&#x27;t want to move their valuable asset around for token-gating or reward distributions.\nEasy migration for flow of funds or liquidity from an external wallet to the embedded wallet for a game.\nVerifiying a number of ERC20 tokens a user holds to provide governance rights.\n\nUsing Sequence SDKs, the embedded wallet session can be instantiated from nearly any platform such as Mobile, Web, PC or Console so users can enjoy a seamless game experience. However, when desired, a verifiable URL is generated for the user to direct them to a browser session to link their external wallets.\n","title":"Wallet Linking Overview","titles":[]},"432":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/link-wallets/overview#try-a-demo","html":"\n<aside data-callout=\"info\"><p>Try out how wallet linking works <a href=\"https://demo-waas-wallet-link-initiator.pages.dev/\">here</a> by authenticating with your social login using an Embedded Wallet</p></aside>\n<p>Dive into the implementation for your own game or application, by following our <a href=\"/solutions/wallets/link-wallets/integration-guide\">integration guide</a>.</p>","isPage":false,"text":"\nTry out how wallet linking works here by authenticating with your social login using an Embedded Wallet\nDive into the implementation for your own game or application, by following our integration guide.","title":"Try a Demo","titles":["Wallet Linking Overview"]},"433":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/checkout#checkout-overview","html":"</header>\n<p>The checkout modal enables developers to easily facilitate cryptocurrency payments.</p>\n<div class=\"text--center\"><img src=\"/img/kit/checkout-modal.png\" alt=\"make it easier for users to checkout with a collectible in your dap with the Kit checkout modal\"/></div>\n<header>","isPage":true,"text":"\nThe checkout modal enables developers to easily facilitate cryptocurrency payments.\n\n","title":"Checkout Overview","titles":[]},"434":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/checkout#integration","html":"</header>\n<p>To integrate the checkout feature, follow these steps:</p>\n<div data-vocs-steps=\"true\"><div data-depth=\"2\">","isPage":false,"text":"\nTo integrate the checkout feature, follow these steps:\n","title":"Integration","titles":[]},"435":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/checkout#1-install-the-kit-checkout-module","html":"<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">npm</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> install</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> @0xsequence/kit-checkout</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D;--shiki-dark:#768390\"># or</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">pnpm</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> install</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> @0xsequence/kit-checkout</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D;--shiki-dark:#768390\"># or</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#F69D50\">yarn</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> add</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> @0xsequence/kit-checkout</span></span></code></pre></div><div data-depth=\"2\">","isPage":false,"text":"npm install @0xsequence/kit-checkout\n# or\npnpm install @0xsequence/kit-checkout\n# or\nyarn add @0xsequence/kit-checkout","title":"1.
