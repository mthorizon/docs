Using these, you can simply queue up a bunch of transactions; these transactions will be automatically combined if possible (e.g. instead of having &#x27;mint(amount: 5, tokenId: 11)&#x27; and &#x27;mint(amount: 3, tokenId: 11)&#x27;, these would get combined to &#x27;mint(amount: 8, tokenId: 11)&#x27;). Then, you can have your transactions be submitted ever x seconds or whenever a function call is made but no sooner than every y seconds (overrideable for high-value transactions), etc. To learn more about working with the TransactionQueuers, please see this doc.\nFinally, you&#x27;ll want to check for failures in your transactions and handle the errors appropriately.\n","title":"How to implement this with Unity?","titles":["Building Transaction Heavy Games with Unity"]},"10":{"href":"/guides/building-transaction-heavy-games-with-unity#example","html":"\n<p>For an example of these concepts in action in our Unity SDK, please checkout our <a href=\"http://localhost:5173/guides/jelly-forest-unity-guide#5-mint-in-game-tokens-to-the-players-inventory\">Jelly Forest Guide</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity-demo/tree/master/Scripts\">sample code</a>.</p>","isPage":false,"text":"\nFor an example of these concepts in action in our Unity SDK, please checkout our Jelly Forest Guide and sample code.","title":"Example","titles":["Building Transaction Heavy Games with Unity"]},"11":{"href":"/solutions/monetization-overview#monetization-overview","html":"</header>\n<p>Sequence provides a suite of options to more effectively monetize your blockchain-enabled game like our various <strong>Marketplace</strong> options and <strong>Sequence Pay</strong> - the ultimate toolkit for onboarding users to your game from fiat or crypto.</p>\n","isPage":true,"text":"\nSequence provides a suite of options to more effectively monetize your blockchain-enabled game like our various Marketplace options and Sequence Pay - the ultimate toolkit for onboarding users to your game from fiat or crypto.\n","title":"Monetization Overview","titles":[]},"12":{"href":"/solutions/monetization-overview#sequence-marketplaces","html":"\n<p><strong>White-Label Marketplace</strong>:\nStart your browser-based marketplace in minutes, even if you have no coding experience.
