The idToken is obtained from the social auth provider and used to open a session. You can see a sample React application using Google auth below. To see a complete application, see the demo-waas-auth repository. A functional demo is also available here.\nBegin with a simple main.tsx file that sets up the WaaS SDK, the router, and the Google OAuth provider.\nimport { SequenceWaaS } from &quot;@0xsequence/waas&quot;;\nimport { GoogleOAuthProvider } from &quot;@react-oauth/google&quot;;\nimport { createHashRouter, RouterProvider } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;;\n \nconst waas = new SequenceWaaS(\n  {\n    projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,\n    waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,\n    network: &quot;mumbai&quot;,\n  },\n  defaults.TEST\n);\n \nexport const router = createHashRouter([\n  {\n    path: &quot;/login&quot;,\n    element: &lt;Login /&gt;,\n  },\n  {\n    path: &quot;/&quot;,\n    element: &lt;App /&gt;,\n  },\n]);\n \nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(&quot;root&quot;)!).render(\n  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;\n    &lt;GoogleOAuthProvider clientId={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}&gt;\n      &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n    &lt;/GoogleOAuthProvider&gt;\n  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;\n);\nThe useSessionHash hook is used to obtain a session hash that is used to prevent replay attacks. The sequence.getSessionHash function is used to obtain the session hash, and the sequence.onSessionStateChanged function is used to update the session hash when the session state changes.\nimport { sequence } from &quot;./main&quot;;\nimport { useEffect, useState } from &quot;react&quot;;\n \nexport function useSessionHash() {\n  const [sessionHash, setSessionHash] = useState(&quot;&quot;);\n  const [error, setError] = useState&lt;any&gt;(undefined);\n \n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const handler = async () =&gt; {\n      try {\n        setSessionHash(await sequence.getSessionHash());\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        setError(error);\n      }\n    };\n    handler();\n    return sequence.onSessionStateChanged(handler);\n  }, [setSessionHash, setError]);\n \n  return {\n    sessionHash,\n    error,\n    loading: !!sessionHash,\n  };\n}\nTo handle the Google login, you can use the GoogleLogin component from the @react-oauth/google package. The handleGoogleLogin function is called when the user successfully logs in.\nimport { router, sequence } from &#x27;./main&#x27;\nimport { CredentialResponse, GoogleLogin } from &#x27;@react-oauth/google&#x27;\nimport { useSessionHash } from &quot;./useSessionHash.ts&quot;;\n \nfunction Login() {\n  const { sessionHash } = useSessionHash()\n  const [signingIn, setSigningIn] = useState(false)\n \n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    (async () =&gt; {\n      if (await sequence.isSignedIn()) {\n        router.navigate(&#x27;/&#x27;)\n      }\n    })()\n  }, [])\n \n  const handleGoogleLogin = async (tokenResponse: CredentialResponse) =&gt; {\n    const walletAddress = await sequence.signIn({\n      idToken: tokenResponse.credential!\n    }, &quot;MacBook Pro - Chrome&quot;)\n \n    console.log(`Wallet address: ${walletAddress}`)\n    router.navigate(&#x27;/&#x27;)\n  }\n \n  return (\n    {!!sessionHash &amp;&amp; (&lt;&gt;\n      &lt;GoogleLogin onSuccess={handleGoogleLogin} shape=&quot;circle&quot; width={230} nonce={sessionHash} /&gt;\n    &lt;/&gt;)}\n )\n}\n \nexport default Login\n","title":"Google / Apple Auth","titles":["Session Management","Sign in / Sign Up"]},"423":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/03-manage-sessions#list-sessions","html":"\n<p>This function returns a list of sessions for the current user and only includes sessions that are still valid.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">import</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> { SequenceWaaS } </span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">from</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> &quot;@0xsequence/waas&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\" data-empty-line=\"true\"> </span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">const</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\"> waas</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> new</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\"> SequenceWaaS</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">(</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    projectAccessKey: </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">`${</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">process</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">env</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">}`</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    waasConfigKey: </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">`${</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">process</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">env</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">WAAS_CONFIG_KEY</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">}`</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    network: </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">&quot;mumbai&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  },</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  defaults.</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">TEST</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\" data-empty-line=\"true\"> </span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">await</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> waas.</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\">signIn</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">({ idToken }, </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">&quot;MacBook Pro -
