For instance, if your game involves collecting a lot of coins (or similar) as low-value transactions, you&#x27;ll likely want to make use o the PermissionedMinterTransactionQueuer (assuming your mint function has permissions, the default, and you are minting from a server) or the SequenceWalletTransactionQueuer (if anyone can mint). Using these, you can simply queue up a bunch of transactions; these transactions will be automatically combined if possible (e.g. instead of having &#x27;mint(amount: 5, tokenId: 11)&#x27; and &#x27;mint(amount: 3, tokenId: 11)&#x27;, these would get combined to &#x27;mint(amount: 8, tokenId: 11)&#x27;). Then, you can have your transactions be submitted ever x seconds or whenever a function call is made but no sooner than every y seconds (overrideable for high-value transactions), etc. To learn more about working with the TransactionQueuers, please see this doc.\nFinally, you&#x27;ll want to check for failures in your transactions and handle the errors appropriately.\n","title":"How to implement this with Unity?","titles":["Building Transaction Heavy Games with Unity"]},"10":{"href":"/guides/building-transaction-heavy-games-with-unity#example","html":"\n<p>For an example of these concepts in action in our Unity SDK, please checkout our <a href=\"http://localhost:5173/guides/jelly-forest-unity-guide#5-mint-in-game-tokens-to-the-players-inventory\">Jelly Forest Guide</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity-demo/tree/master/Scripts\">sample code</a>.</p>","isPage":false,"text":"\nFor an example of these concepts in action in our Unity SDK, please checkout our Jelly Forest Guide and sample code.","title":"Example","titles":["Building Transaction Heavy Games with Unity"]},"11":{"href":"/solutions/monetization-overview#monetization-overview","html":"</header>\n<p>Sequence provides a suite of options to more effectively monetize your blockchain-enabled game like our various <strong>Marketplace</strong> options and <strong>Sequence Pay</strong> - the ultimate toolkit for onboarding users to your game from fiat or crypto.</p>\n","isPage":true,"text":"\nSequence provides a suite of options to more effectively monetize your blockchain-enabled game like our various Marketplace options and Sequence Pay - the ultimate toolkit for onboarding users to your game from fiat or crypto.\n","title":"Monetization Overview","titles":[]},"12":{"href":"/solutions/monetization-overview#sequence-marketplaces","html":"\n<p><strong>White-Label Marketplace</strong>:\nStart your browser-based marketplace in minutes, even if you have no coding experience.

your users to install anything By integrating 0xsequence, users may access your dapp without having to install any special extensions,\nand the wallet also works on mobile browsers!\nYour dapp can
