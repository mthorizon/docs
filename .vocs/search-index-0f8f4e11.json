the Polygon network. You may query any contract address on any of the supported networks (but make\nsure to query the indexer of the corresponding network).\nSequence Indexer GetTokenSupplies Method:\n\nRequest: POST /rpc/Indexer/GetTokenSupplies\nContent-Type: application/json\nBody (in JSON):\n\ncontractAddress (string) -- a ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC1155 contract address\nincludeMetadata (boolean - optional - default: false) -- toggle token metadata to be included in the response\nmetadataOptions (object - optional) -- additional options for metadata\n\nverifiedOnly (boolean - optional) -- return only contracts which are &#x27;verified&#x27; to help reduce spam\nincludeContracts ([]string - optional) -- list of specific contract addresses to always be included, even if verifiedOnly is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: GetTokenSupplies of Skyweaver contract on Polygon using an c3bgcU3LkFR9Bp9jFssLenPAAAAAAAAAA\ncurl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Access-Key: c3bgcU3LkFR9Bp9jFssLenPAAAAAAAAAA&quot; https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app/rpc/Indexer/GetTokenSupplies -d &#x27;{ &quot;contractAddress&quot;: &quot;0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E&quot;, &quot;includeMetadata&quot;: true }&#x27;// Works in both a Webapp (browser) or Node.js:\nimport { SequenceIndexer } from &#x27;@0xsequence/indexer&#x27;\n \nconst indexer = new SequenceIndexer(&#x27;https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app&#x27;, &#x27;c3bgcU3LkFR9Bp9jFssLenPAAAAAAAAAA&#x27;)\n \n// here we query the Skyweaver contract address, but you can use any\nconst contractAddress = &#x27;0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E&#x27;\n \n// query Sequence Indexer for all token details / supplies\nconst tokenDetails = await indexer.getTokenSupplies({\n\tcontractAddress: contractAddress,\n\tincludeMetadata: true\n})\nconsole.log(&#x27;token details of contract:&#x27;, tokenDetails)go\nimport (\n\t&quot;context&quot;\n\t&quot;fmt&quot;\n\t&quot;log&quot;\n\t&quot;net/http&quot;\n \n\t&quot;github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence/indexer&quot;\n)\n \nfunc GetTokenSupplies(contractAddress string) {\n\tseqIndexer := indexer.NewIndexer(&quot;https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app&quot;, &quot;c3bgcU3LkFR9Bp9jFssLenPAAAAAAAAAA&quot;)\n \n\tfilter := &amp;indexer.TransactionHistoryFilter{\n\t\tContractAddress: &amp;contractAddress,\n\t}\n\tincludeMetadata := true\n \n\t_, tokenDetails, err := seqIndexer.GetTokenSupplies(context.Background(), filter, nil, &amp;includeMetadata)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tfmt.Println(&quot;token details:&quot;, tokenDetails)\n}","title":"Fetch all unique tokens in a particular ERC20/721/1155 contract, including total supplies","titles":["Tokens in a contract",null]},"206":{"href":"/api/indexer/examples/webhook-listener#webhook","html":"</header>\n","isPage":true,"text":"\n","title":"Webhook","titles":[]},"207":{"href":"/api/indexer/examples/webhook-listener#listen-to-blockchain-events-with-webhooks","html":"\n<p>You can listen to transactions via webhooks using the Sequence Indexer.
