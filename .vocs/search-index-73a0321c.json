integrating 0xsequence, users may access your dapp without having to install any special extensions,\nand the wallet also works on mobile browsers!\n:::\nYour dapp can connect to your user&#x27;s wallet by first instantiating the Wallet provider:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\n \nconst projectAccessKey = &#x27;&lt;access_key&gt;&#x27;\n \n// This assumes your dapp runs on Ethereum mainnet\nconst wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey);\n \n// If your dapp runs on a different EVM-compatible blockchain, you can specify its name\n// const wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey, { defaultNetwork: &#x27;polygon&#x27; });\nNote that is possible to retrieve the above instance by using the getWallet() method:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\nOnce you have the instance, you can connect to the wallet:\nconst connectDetails = await wallet.connect({\n  app: &quot;Your Dapp name&quot;,\n  authorize: true,\n  // And pass settings if you would like to customize further\n  settings: {\n    theme: &quot;light&quot;,\n    bannerUrl:

The idToken is obtained from the social auth provider and used to open a session. You can see a sample React application using Google auth below. To see a complete application, see the demo-waas-auth repository. A functional demo is also available here.\nBegin with a simple main.tsx file that sets up the WaaS SDK, the router, and the Google OAuth provider.\nimport { SequenceWaaS } from &quot;@0xsequence/waas&quot;;\nimport { GoogleOAuthProvider } from &quot;@react-oauth/google&quot;;\nimport { createHashRouter, RouterProvider } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;;\n \nconst waas = new SequenceWaaS(\n  {\n    projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,\n    waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,\n    network: &quot;mumbai&quot;,\n  },\n  defaults.TEST\n);\n \nexport const router = createHashRouter([\n  {\n    path: &quot;/login&quot;,\n    element: &lt;Login /&gt;,\n  },\n  {\n    path: &quot;/&quot;,\n    element: &lt;App /&gt;,\n  },\n]);\n \nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(&quot;root&quot;)!).render(\n  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;\n    &lt;GoogleOAuthProvider clientId={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}&gt;\n      &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n    &lt;/GoogleOAuthProvider&gt;\n  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;\n);\nThe useSessionHash hook is used to obtain a session hash that is used to prevent replay attacks. The sequence.getSessionHash function is used to obtain the session hash, and the sequence.onSessionStateChanged function is used to update the session hash when the session state changes.\nimport { sequence } from &quot;./main&quot;;\nimport { useEffect, useState } from &quot;react&quot;;\n \nexport function useSessionHash() {\n  const [sessionHash, setSessionHash] = useState(&quot;&quot;);\n  const [error, setError] = useState&lt;any&gt;(undefined);\n \n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const handler = async () =&gt; {\n      try {\n        setSessionHash(await sequence.getSessionHash());\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        setError(error);\n      }\n    };\n    handler();\n    return sequence.onSessionStateChanged(handler);\n  }, [setSessionHash, setError]);\n \n  return {\n    sessionHash,\n    error,\n    loading: !!sessionHash,\n  };\n}\nTo handle the Google login, you can use the GoogleLogin component from the @react-oauth/google package. The handleGoogleLogin function is called when the user successfully logs in.\nimport { router, sequence } from &#x27;./main&#x27;\nimport { CredentialResponse, GoogleLogin } from &#x27;@react-oauth/google&#x27;\nimport { useSessionHash } from &quot;./useSessionHash.ts&quot;;\n \nfunction Login() {\n  const { sessionHash } = useSessionHash()\n  const [signingIn, setSigningIn] = useState(false)\n \n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    (async () =&gt; {\n      if (await sequence.isSignedIn()) {\n        router.navigate(&#x27;/&#x27;)\n      }\n    })()\n  }, [])\n \n  const handleGoogleLogin = async (tokenResponse: CredentialResponse) =&gt; {\n    const walletAddress = await sequence.signIn({\n      idToken: tokenResponse.credential!\n    }, &quot;MacBook Pro - Chrome&quot;)\n \n    console.log(`Wallet address: ${walletAddress}`)\n    router.navigate(&#x27;/&#x27;)\n  }\n \n  return (\n    {!!sessionHash &amp;&amp; (&lt;&gt;\n      &lt;GoogleLogin onSuccess={handleGoogleLogin} shape=&quot;circle&quot; width={230} nonce={sessionHash} /&gt;\n    &lt;/&gt;)}\n )\n}\n \nexport default Login\n","title":"Google / Apple Auth","titles":["Session Management","Sign in / Sign Up"]},"448":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/03-manage-sessions#list-sessions","html":"\n<p>This function returns a list of sessions for the current user and only includes sessions that are still valid.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">import</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> { SequenceWaaS } </span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">from</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\"> &quot;@0xsequence/waas&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\" data-empty-line=\"true\"> </span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">const</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\"> waas</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\"> new</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\"> SequenceWaaS</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">(</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    projectAccessKey: </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">`${</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">process</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">env</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">}`</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    waasConfigKey: </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">`${</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">process</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">env</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">.</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">WAAS_CONFIG_KEY</span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">}`</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">    network: </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">&quot;mumbai&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  },</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">  defaults.</span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">TEST</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\" data-empty-line=\"true\"> </span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F47067\">await</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> waas.</span><span style=\"color:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#DCBDFB\">signIn</span><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">({ idToken }, </span><span style=\"color:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#96D0FF\">&quot;MacBook Pro -
