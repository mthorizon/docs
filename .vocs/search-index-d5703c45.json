This process is complicated and error-prone so we&#x27;ve abstracted it all away so that you don&#x27;t have to deal with it. But, if you&#x27;re curious to learn how it works, please see this document.\nA DelayedEncode transaction allows you to call any method on an arbitrary smart contract, allowing us to handle the complicated ABI encoding process.\nTo send a DelayedEncode transaction, you can use this code snippet:\n_wallet.SendTransaction(Chain.Polygon, new SequenceSDK.WaaS.Transaction[]\n    {\n        new DelayedEncode(ContractAddress, ValueAsString, new DelayedEncodeData(\n            ContractABIAsString,\n            ParametersAsObjectArray,\n            FunctionNameAsString)),\n    });\nLet&#x27;s examine the above to get a better understanding of some of the variables that may be non-obvious.\nValueAsString: This will usually be &quot;0&quot; unless you are calling a payable method denoted by the payable keyword in the smart contract definition. If you are calling a payable method, it is recommended to use DecimalNormalizer.Normalize to convert the amount from human readable format to EVM format.\nContractABIAsString: This can either be the entire ABI or just the function you plan on interacting with. If you&#x27;re not familiar with ABIs, we&#x27;d recommend copy-pasting the function signature (with parameters) from the contract source code on Etherscan (or the appropriate block explorer for your network) and removing the whitespace and variable names.\nParametersAsObjectArray: The parameters you want to provide to the method you wish to call. No need to provide the parameter names, just their values in the order they appear in the ABI. Provide parameters in string format when in doubt.\nFunctionNameAsString: The name of the function you want to call as it appears in the ABI (or source code). Exclude parentheses and parameters.\nPutting this together, an example of using delayed encode to call the &quot;mint&quot; function on an ERC20 would look like this:\n_wallet.SendTransaction(Chain.Polygon, new SequenceSDK.WaaS.Transaction[]\n    {\n        new DelayedEncode(ContractAddress, &quot;0&quot;, new DelayedEncodeData(\n            &quot;mint(address,uint256)&quot;,\n            new object[]\n            {\n                ToAddress, DecimalNormalizer.Normalize(1)\n            },\n            &quot;mint&quot;)),\n    });\n","title":"DelayedEncode","titles":["Write to Blockchain"]},"127":{"href":"/sdk/unity/write-to-blockchain#batch-transactions","html":"\n<p>Using the magic of the Sequence Smart Contract wallet, our SDK allows you to seemlessly batch transactions together.

The idToken is obtained from the social auth provider and used to open a session. You can see a sample React application using Google auth below. To see a complete application, see the demo-waas-auth repository. A functional demo is also available here.\nBegin with a simple main.tsx file that sets up the WaaS SDK, the router, and the Google OAuth provider.\nimport { SequenceWaaS } from &#x27;@0xsequence/waas&#x27;\nimport { GoogleOAuthProvider } from &#x27;@react-oauth/google&#x27;\nimport { createHashRouter, RouterProvider } from &#x27;react-router-dom&#x27;\n \nconst waas = new SequenceWaaS({\n  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,\n  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,\n  network: &#x27;arbitrum-nova&#x27;\n})\n \nexport const router = createHashRouter([\n  {\n    path: &#x27;/login&#x27;,\n    element: &lt;Login /&gt;\n  },\n  {\n    path: &#x27;/&#x27;,\n    element: &lt;App /&gt;\n  }\n])\n \nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(&#x27;root&#x27;)!).render(\n  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;\n      &lt;GoogleOAuthProvider clientId={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}&gt;\n        &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n      &lt;/GoogleOAuthProvider&gt;\n  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;\n)\nThe useSessionHash hook is used to obtain a session hash that is used to prevent replay attacks. The sequence.getSessionHash function is used to obtain the session hash, and the sequence.onSessionStateChanged function is used to update the session hash when the session state changes.\nimport { sequence } from &#x27;./main&#x27;\nimport { useEffect, useState } from &quot;react&quot;;\n \nexport function useSessionHash() {\n    const [sessionHash, setSessionHash] = useState(&quot;&quot;)\n    const [error, setError] = useState&lt;any&gt;(undefined)\n \n    useEffect(() =&gt; {\n        const handler = async () =&gt; {\n            try {\n                setSessionHash(await sequence.getSessionHash())\n            } catch (error) {\n                console.error(error)\n                setError(error)\n            }\n        }\n        handler()\n        return sequence.onSessionStateChanged(handler)\n    }, [setSessionHash, setError])\n \n    return {\n        sessionHash,\n        error,\n        loading: !!sessionHash,\n    }\n}\nTo handle the Google login, you can use the GoogleLogin component from the @react-oauth/google package. The handleGoogleLogin function is called when the user successfully logs in.\nMake sure to re-render the component whenever sessionHash changes to avoid hard-to-track discrepancy errors. For example, you can use the key attribute to force the re-render.\nimport { router, sequence } from &#x27;./main&#x27;\nimport { CredentialResponse, GoogleLogin } from &#x27;@react-oauth/google&#x27;\nimport { useSessionHash } from &quot;./useSessionHash.ts&quot;;\n \nfunction Login() {\n  const { sessionHash } = useSessionHash()\n  const [signingIn, setSigningIn] = useState(false)\n \n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    (async () =&gt; {\n      if (await sequence.isSignedIn()) {\n        router.navigate(&#x27;/&#x27;)\n      }\n    })()\n  }, [])\n \n  const handleGoogleLogin = async (tokenResponse: CredentialResponse) =&gt; {\n    const walletAddress = await sequence.signIn({\n      idToken: tokenResponse.credential!\n    }, &quot;MacBook Pro -
