and deploy asset metadata to such as an image to that token.\n\n\nCall CreateCollection endpoint - ensure you pass in the Secret Service Token created in the prior section.\n\n\nCreateToken - use returned collectionId from previous request\n\n\nCreateAsset - use collectionId and your tokenId\n\nset metadataField (assetType) to one of the following\n\nimage\nanimation_url\naudio\nvideo\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload file with PUT method to this endpoint PUT {metadata-server}/projects/{projectId}/collections/{collectionId}/tokens/{tokenId}/upload/{assetIdOrAssetType}- use assetId that is returned in step 3 OR, you can pass assetType, such as &quot;image&quot;\n\n\n\nFor example you can upload to https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1/tokens/1/upload/image which will find the asset of the type &quot;image&quot; for the token, and will upload there.\n\nYou can also pass in the assetId if you prefer, i.e., PUT https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1/assets/1/upload\n\n\nAsset types include: image, audio, video, animation_url\n\n\n\nAsset is now privately accessible with JWT token at GET {metadata-server}/projects/{projectID}/collections/{collectionID}/tokens/{tokenID}/asset/{assetType}\n\nfor example: https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1/tokens/1/asset/image\n\n\n\nPublishCollection -- this sets the collection to be accessible by the public\n\n\nGetCollection -- will return both baseURIs for contract and token level metadata.\n\n\n\nCollection-level metadata (aka contract-level) metadata: https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1 or https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1.json\nToken-level metadata: https://metadata.sequence.app/projects/486/collections/1/tokens/{tokenId}\n\nie.

Simply include multiple transactions, of any type, in your transaction array when making the SendTransaction request.\nFor example - sending a transaction of each type in a batch:\n_wallet.SendTransaction(\n    Chain.Polygon,\n    new Sequence.EmbeddedWallet.Transaction[]\n    {\n        new RawTransaction(ToAddress, DecimalNormalizer.Normalize(1)),\n        new SendERC20(\n            erc20TokenAddress,\n            ToAddress,\n            AmountAsString),\n        new RawTransaction(new ERC20(erc20TokenAddress).Burn(DecimalNormalizer.NormalizeAsBigInteger(amount))),\n        new SendERC721(\n            erc721TokenAddress,\n            ToAddress,\n            TokenIdAsString),\n        new SendERC1155(\n            erc1155TokenAddress,\n            ToAddress,\n            new SendERC1155Values[]\n            {\n                new SendERC1155Values(TokenIdAsString, AmountAsString),\n                ...\n            }),\n        new DelayedEncode(ContractAddress, ValueAsString, new DelayedEncodeData(\n            ContractABIAsString,\n            ParametersAsObjectArray,\n            FunctionNameAsString)),\n    });\nSince these transactions are all batched into a single transaction by the Sequence Smart Contract Wallet before being submitted to the network, you will receive only one transaction receipt.\n","title":"Batch Transactions","titles":["Write to Blockchain"]},"133":{"href":"/sdk/unity/write-to-blockchain#feeoptions","html":"\n<p>By default, the SDK will automatically sponsor all Embedded Wallet transactions using your Builder API credits.

your users to install anything By integrating 0xsequence, users may access your dapp without having to install any special extensions,\nand the wallet also works on mobile browsers!\nYour dapp can connect to your user&#x27;s wallet by first instantiating the Wallet provider:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\n \nconst projectAccessKey = &#x27;&lt;access_key&gt;&#x27;\n \n// This assumes your dapp runs on Ethereum mainnet\nconst wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey);\n \n// If your dapp runs on a different EVM-compatible blockchain, you can specify its name\n// const wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey, { defaultNetwork: &#x27;polygon&#x27; });\nNote that is possible to retrieve the above instance by using the getWallet() method:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\nOnce you have the instance, you can connect to the wallet:\nconst connectDetails = await wallet.connect({\n  app: &quot;Your Dapp name&quot;,\n  authorize: true,\n  // And pass settings if you would like to customize further\n  settings: {\n    theme: &quot;light&quot;,\n    bannerUrl:

If a user attempts to login using a different method but the same email as before, they will receive an EmailAlreadyInUse error.\nFor example: if the user created their account using Google Sign In and then attemps to sign in with Email + OTP using the same method, they will receive this error.\nBefore the sign in attempt, make sure to bind to the FederateSuccess, FederateFailure, and FederateOrForce delegates. The FederateOrForce delegate will be triggered in the case where the SDK receives the EmailAlreadyInUse error from the API.\nThe FederateOrForce delegate will include FFederationSupportData which will contain the email used to sign in and a list of login methods associated with that email with the Sequence API.\nWith this information, you can present up to two options for the user to proceed:\n\nPrompt the user to login with one of the login methods included in the FFederationSupportData object. Once the user successfully logs in with one of the prompted login methods, the SDK will automatically federate their account using the cached login attempt that failed. e.g. if you previously logged in with Google, then tried to login with email and receive the EmailAlreadyInUse error; after you login with Google again, your email will automatically be associated with your account. In subsequent sessions, you can now login with email + OTP to the same account.\nAllow the user to force create a new account. This will give your user a separate account and wallet address. This can be done by calling UAuthenticator::ForceOpenLastOpenSessionAttempt.

The passed sequence wallet is inserted in the &#x27;sequenceWallet&#x27; column.\nIf a user doesn&#x27;t exist in the database, insert the passed information as a net-new user.\n\n\n\nAsset Migration\n\nAfter the user is successfully logged in, the system checks if asset migration has already occurred.\nIf not, a prompt is displayed to the user, explaining the need to migrate their assets from their old wallet to the new Sequence Embedded Wallet.\nThe user logs in to the previous provider as a one-time event, and migrates the desired assets to their new sequence wallet.\nWe suggest using Sequence&#x27;s Indexer to query the relevant assets to display these along with amounts to the user for ease of migration.\n\n\n\nPlease get in touch with any questions if your migration is more complex and we are happy to help.","title":"Just-In-Time Migration Process","titles":["Migration Guide: Moving to Sequence Embedded Wallets"]},"471":{"href":"/solutions/wallets/link-wallets/overview#wallet-linking-overview","html":"</header>\n<p>Wallet Linking enables the ability for a developer to create a verifiable association between two wallets from a single user.
