Do 4 damage to it.&quot;,\n    &quot;image&quot;: &quot;https://assets.skyweaver.net/TNqWLuJZ/webapp/cards/full-cards/6x/20-silver.png&quot;,\n    &quot;decimals&quot;: 2,\n    &quot;properties&quot;: {\n      &quot;baseCardId&quot;: 20,\n      &quot;goldCardId&quot;: 131092,\n      &quot;grade&quot;: &quot;oldSilver&quot;,\n      &quot;id&quot;: 20,\n      &quot;silverCardId&quot;: 65556\n    },\n    &quot;attributes&quot;: null\n  }\n]\nIf you&#x27;d like to query a number of tokens at the same time, you can include more token ids comma-separated https://metadata.sequence.app/tokens/polygon/0x.../20,21,22 -- click\nto see the JSON response to query token ids 20, 21, and 22 in a single batched request.\nFeel free to try tweaking the metadata.sequence.app URL above for your own contract, or another popular\nproject to see how the responses come back. You can change the network to one of our supported networks\nand specify any contract and/or token id.\nIn addition to easily querying token-level metadata like in the above example, you can also query contract-level metadata.\nContract-level metadata provides you more information about a contract address such as a name, contract type, logo, and description.\nSimply change the metadata URL above to just query the contract address\nand see result:\n{\n  &quot;chainId&quot;: 137,\n  &quot;address&quot;: &quot;0x631998e91476da5b870d741192fc5cbc55f5a52e&quot;,\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Skyweaver&quot;,\n  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ERC1155&quot;,\n  &quot;symbol&quot;: &quot;SKYWVR&quot;,\n  &quot;logoURI&quot;: &quot;https://assets.skyweaver.net/_tX5dRVi/webapp/icons/skyweaver-token.png&quot;,\n  &quot;extensions&quot;: {\n    &quot;link&quot;: &quot;https://www.skyweaver.net/&quot;,\n    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Skyweaver is a Free-to-Play, trading card game powered by Polygon and Ethereum.&quot;,\n    &quot;ogImage&quot;: &quot;https://skyweaver.net/images/skyweavercover.jpg&quot;,\n    &quot;originAddress&quot;: &quot;0x631998e91476da5b870d741192fc5cbc55f5a52e&quot;\n  }\n}\n\n","title":"Example","titles":["Metadata REST API Reference &amp; Usage"]},"40":{"href":"/api/metadata/rest-api#usage","html":"\n<p>The Metadata API service is accessible either with a simple <a href=\"#rest-endpoints\">REST interface</a>, or a <a href=\"#rpc-client\">RPC client</a>.\nFor the RPC client, we offer Web browser, node and Go clients.

For example:\npublic void OnSignMessageCompleteHandler(string signature) {\n    // Do something\n}\n\npublic void OnWalletCreatedHander(SequenceWallet wallet) {\n    wallet.OnSignMessageComplete += OnSignMessageCompleteHandler;\n}\n_wallet.SignMessage(Chain.Polygon, &quot;Message to sign&quot;);\nIf you&#x27;re unfamiliar with working with events in Unity, check out this great Reddit post!","title":"Sign Messages","titles":[]},"101":{"href":"/sdk/unity/v2-to-v3-upgrade-guide#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3","html":"</header>\n","isPage":true,"text":"\n","title":"Upgrading from v2 to v3","titles":[]},"102":{"href":"/sdk/unity/v2-to-v3-upgrade-guide#installation","html":"\n<p>If you&#x27;ve installed via Package Manager using the git url, please perform the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove Sequence-Unity package</li>\n<li>Re-install using <code>https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity.git?path=/Packages/Sequence-Unity</code> as the link</li>\n</ol>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nIf you&#x27;ve installed via Package Manager using the git url, please perform the following:\n\nRemove Sequence-Unity package\nRe-install using https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity.git?path=/Packages/Sequence-Unity as the link\n\n","title":"Installation","titles":["Upgrading from v2 to v3"]},"103":{"href":"/sdk/unity/v2-to-v3-upgrade-guide#resolving-compile-errors","html":"\n<ol>\n<li>Delete <code>Samples/Sequence WaaS SDK/version/Setup/Editor</code> - this is now included in the SDK</li>\n<li>All namespaces (using statements) that contain <code>WaaS</code> have been replaced with <code>Sequence.EmbeddedWallet</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, if you have</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>using Sequence.WaaS;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>using Sequence.WaaS.Authentication;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>using SequenceSDK.WaaS;</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Replace this with</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>using Sequence.EmbeddedWallet;</span></span></code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p><code>WaaSTransactionQueuer</code> -&gt; <code>SequenceWalletTransactionQueuer</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>WaaSWallet</code> -&gt; <code>SequenceWallet</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In general, any class, method, or event that contains <code>WaaS</code> in the name and gives you a compile error has had <code>WaaS</code> removed from its name (with the exception of the few previously mentioned classes)\nExamples:\n<code>OnWaaSWalletCreated</code> -&gt; <code>OnWalletCreated</code>\n<code>WaaSSession</code> -&gt; <code>Session</code>\n<code>EthWallet</code> -&gt; <code>EOAWallet</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For any existing <code>LoginPanel</code> instances</p>\n<p>a.

However, in some niche use cases, you may find that you would prefer not to sponsor your users&#x27; transactions. This requires that your users are more experienced Web3 users and have tokens/gas currency in their wallet that can be used to pay gas fees. In addition to the gas currency for the selected network, gas fees can also be paid using select ERC20 and ERC1155 tokens.\nTransaction sponsoring is only available for Developer tier and above. For more information on gas sponsoring, please see this document. For more information on upgrading your project billing tier, please see this guide.\nFirst, you&#x27;ll need to assemble the transaction(s) you wish to submit in a batch. Then, you need to request the FeeOptions.\nTransaction[] transactions = new Transaction[]\n{\n    // Create your transactions here\n};\nFeeOptionsResponse response = await _wallet.GetFeeOptions(chain, transactions);\nThe FeeOptionsResponse contains a FeeQuote (string) that locks in the price for each FeeOptionReturn in the FeeOptions array that is returned for a limited time; you&#x27;ll need this in a moment when submitting your transactions. For your convenience, the SDK will automatically query the user&#x27;s wallet to see which of the FeeOptions the user can afford using the Indexer.\nFrom here, you can display a UI to the user to allow them to select how they would like to pay the fee for their transactions.\nOnce the user has selected how they&#x27;d like to pay their fee, you may submit the transactions, including the selected FeeOption and the FeeQuote string.\n_wallet.SendTransactionWithFeeOptions(chain, transactions, response.FeeOptions[selectionIndex].FeeOption, response.FeeQuote);\nIn the Demo Scene that can be imported via Package Manager &gt; Samples, you can see a barebones example usage of FeeOptions.

will return at most one token instance from each contract.\nIn order to fetch ERC721/1155 token balances, you must pass the contractAddress to the GetTokenBalances method.\nThis will return all of the tokens owned by accountAddress from the specified contractAddress.\nSee section below for more information.\n","title":"Fetches list of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens and metadata in any

You may query any contract address on any of the supported networks (but make\nsure to query the indexer of the corresponding network).\nSequence Indexer GetTokenSupplies Method:\n\nRequest: POST /rpc/Indexer/GetTokenSupplies\nContent-Type: application/json\nBody (in JSON):\n\ncontractAddress (string) -- a ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC1155 contract address\nincludeMetadata (boolean - optional - default: false) -- toggle token metadata to be included in the response\nmetadataOptions (object - optional) -- additional options for metadata\n\nverifiedOnly (boolean - optional) -- return only contracts which are &#x27;verified&#x27; to help reduce spam\nincludeContracts ([]string - optional) -- list of specific contract addresses to always be included, even if verifiedOnly is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: GetTokenSupplies of Skyweaver contract on Polygon using an AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY\ncurl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Access-Key: AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY&quot; https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app/rpc/Indexer/GetTokenSupplies -d &#x27;{ &quot;contractAddress&quot;: &quot;0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E&quot;, &quot;includeMetadata&quot;: true }&#x27;// Works in both a Webapp (browser) or Node.js:\nimport { SequenceIndexer } from &#x27;@0xsequence/indexer&#x27;\n \nconst indexer = new SequenceIndexer(&#x27;https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app&#x27;, &#x27;AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY&#x27;)\n \n// here we query the Skyweaver contract address, but you can use any\nconst contractAddress = &#x27;0x631998e91476DA5B870D741192fc5Cbc55F5a52E&#x27;\n \n// query Sequence Indexer for all token details / supplies\nconst tokenDetails = await indexer.getTokenSupplies({\n\tcontractAddress: contractAddress,\n\tincludeMetadata: true\n})\nconsole.log(&#x27;token details of contract:&#x27;, tokenDetails)go\nimport (\n\t&quot;context&quot;\n\t&quot;fmt&quot;\n\t&quot;log&quot;\n\t&quot;net/http&quot;\n \n\t&quot;github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence/indexer&quot;\n)\n \nfunc GetTokenSupplies(contractAddress string) {\n\tseqIndexer := indexer.NewIndexer(&quot;https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app&quot;, &quot;AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY&quot;)\n \n\tmetadataOptions := indexer.MetadataOptions{\n\t\tVerifiedOnly:     true, // Set to true if you want to fetch only verified contracts\n\t\tUnverifiedOnly:   false,\n\t\tIncludeContracts: nil, // Provide a list of specific contracts to include, if any\n\t}\n \n\t_, _, tokenDetails, err := seqIndexer.GetTokenSupplies(context.Background(), contractAddress, nil, &amp;metadataOptions, nil)\n\t\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n \n\tfmt.Println(&quot;token details:&quot;, tokenDetails)\n}","title":"Fetch all unique tokens in a particular ERC20/721/1155 contract, including total supplies","titles":["Tokens in a contract",null]},"250":{"href":"/api/marketplace/examples/get-user-activities#getuseractivities","html":"\n<p>Enables you to retrieve activity data for a specific user, including orders and trades.

your users to install anything By integrating 0xsequence, users may access your dapp without having to install any special extensions,\nand the wallet also works on mobile browsers!\nYour dapp can connect to your user&#x27;s wallet by first instantiating the Wallet provider:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\n \nconst projectAccessKey = &#x27;&lt;access_key&gt;&#x27;\n \n// This assumes your dapp runs on Ethereum mainnet\nconst wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey);\n \n// If your dapp runs on a different EVM-compatible blockchain, you can specify its name\n// const wallet = sequence.initWallet(projectAccessKey, { defaultNetwork: &#x27;polygon&#x27; });\nNote that is possible to retrieve the above instance by using the getWallet() method:\nimport { sequence } from &quot;0xsequence&quot;;\nconst wallet = sequence.getWallet();\nOnce you have the instance, you can connect to the wallet:\nconst connectDetails = await wallet.connect({\n  app: &quot;Your Dapp name&quot;,\n  authorize: true,\n  // And pass settings if you would like to customize further\n  settings: {\n    theme: &quot;light&quot;,\n    bannerUrl:
