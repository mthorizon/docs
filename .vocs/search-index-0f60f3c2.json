But of course, the Indexer is a modular piece\nof infrastructure, and you may use it directly from your dapp, game, or even from\na server.\nFeatures:\n\nSuper-fast API to query all token balances, history, metadata and NFTs with multi-chain support\nReal-time indexing of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 transactions across EVM-compatible chains\nAutomatically detects all tokens on the chain, without the need for a contract registry\nResilient to node failures and chain re-organizations\nEasily listen for specific events and transactions on-chain accurately with a simple API\nBuilt-in token / nft metadata support to easily render tokens in your apps / games\nHigh uptime and availability\n\n","title":"Indexer","titles":[]},"34":{"href":"/api/indexer/overview#supported-networks--endpoints","html":"\n<p>You can see the <a href=\"/solutions/technical-references/chain-support\">full list of supported networks here</a>.</p>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nYou can see the full list of supported networks here.\n","title":"Supported Networks &amp; Endpoints","titles":["Indexer"]},"35":{"href":"/api/indexer/overview#getting-started","html":"\n<p>Here are a few example queries you can make to a blockchain from your dapp, game, or wallet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/api/indexer/fetch-tokens\">Fetch all tokens &amp; NFTS in any wallet including all metadata</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/api/indexer/transaction-history\">Fetch the transaction history for any wallet address</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/api/indexer/unique-tokens\">Fetch all unique tokens in a particular ERC20/721/1155 contract, including total supplies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/api/indexer/unique-tokens\">What is the total token supply of an ERC20 token?

The idToken is obtained from the social auth provider and used to open a session. You can see a sample React application using Google auth below. To see a complete application, see the demo-waas-auth repository. A functional demo is also available here.\nBegin with a simple main.tsx file that sets up the WaaS SDK, the router, and the Google OAuth provider.\nimport { SequenceWaaS } from &quot;@0xsequence/waas&quot;;\nimport { GoogleOAuthProvider } from &quot;@react-oauth/google&quot;;\nimport { createHashRouter, RouterProvider } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;;\n \nconst waas = new SequenceWaaS(\n  {\n    projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,\n    waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,\n    network: &quot;mumbai&quot;,\n  },\n  defaults.TEST\n);\n \nexport const router = createHashRouter([\n  {\n    path: &quot;/login&quot;,\n    element: &lt;Login /&gt;,\n  },\n  {\n    path: &quot;/&quot;,\n    element: &lt;App /&gt;,\n  },\n]);\n \nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(&quot;root&quot;)!).render(\n  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;\n    &lt;GoogleOAuthProvider clientId={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}&gt;\n      &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n    &lt;/GoogleOAuthProvider&gt;\n  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;\n);\nThe useSessionHash hook is used to obtain a session hash that is used to prevent replay attacks. The sequence.getSessionHash function is used to obtain the session hash, and the sequence.onSessionStateChanged function is used to update the session hash when the session state changes.\nimport { sequence } from &quot;./main&quot;;\nimport { useEffect, useState } from &quot;react&quot;;\n \nexport function useSessionHash() {\n  const [sessionHash, setSessionHash] = useState(&quot;&quot;);\n  const [error, setError] = useState&lt;any&gt;(undefined);\n \n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const handler = async () =&gt; {\n      try {\n        setSessionHash(await sequence.getSessionHash());\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        setError(error);\n      }\n    };\n    handler();\n    return sequence.onSessionStateChanged(handler);\n  }, [setSessionHash, setError]);\n \n  return {\n    sessionHash,\n    error,\n    loading: !!sessionHash,\n  };\n}\nTo handle the Google login, you can use the GoogleLogin component from the @react-oauth/google package. The handleGoogleLogin function is called when the user successfully logs in.\nimport { router, sequence } from &#x27;./main&#x27;\nimport { CredentialResponse, GoogleLogin } from &#x27;@react-oauth/google&#x27;\nimport { useSessionHash } from &quot;./useSessionHash.ts&quot;;\n \nfunction Login() {\n  const { sessionHash } = useSessionHash()\n  const [signingIn, setSigningIn] = useState(false)\n \n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    (async () =&gt; {\n      if (await sequence.isSignedIn()) {\n        router.navigate(&#x27;/&#x27;)\n      }\n    })()\n  }, [])\n \n  const handleGoogleLogin = async (tokenResponse: CredentialResponse) =&gt; {\n    const walletAddress = await sequence.signIn({\n      idToken: tokenResponse.credential!\n    }, &quot;MacBook Pro -
